&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re in our pre-production phase right now, but you can see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lessthanheroic.samproof.tv/category/video/episodes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;episodes&lt;/a&gt; of a previous web series we&#039;re spinning off of, concept &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lessthanheroic.samproof.tv/category/video/drawing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drawings&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Quick Backstory of our World/Mythos&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shattered in to thousands of pieces what was once a solid planet is now chunks of planetoids floating around in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first season takes place on &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.samproof.tv/wiki/item/illumeria&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;illumeria&lt;/a&gt; is a world of Man, Elves, Orcs and so on... but other planetoids promise other races and cultures lost to the shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re looking to create new beings no one has ever seen before. New lands heroes have never conquered. New fun yet to be had!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staring next week, I&#039;ll be posting my own sketches of monsters every Monday on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lessthanheroic.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.lessthanheroic.com&lt;/a&gt; and leaving the naming and descriptions open to anyone who cares to join in!&lt;/p&gt;

The game uses some fractal-type calculation (i think), because the&lt;br /&gt;
whole thing is a little over 1MB and there are more than that many&lt;br /&gt;
stars. It is not completely random, because the galaxy is the same for&lt;br /&gt;
everyone. A particular seed number producing the same world for&lt;br /&gt;
everyone would be nice. &lt;br/&gt;
What would be really awesome would be a &quot;browser based&quot; app where you&lt;br /&gt;
could click on a section of map for an increasingly detailed view(like&lt;br /&gt;
google maps), down to individual village maps with clickable stats for&lt;br /&gt;
buildings and a list of inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
I don&#039;t want much, do I?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.enworld.org/forum/images/smilies/angel.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Angel&quot; class=&quot;inlineimg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
any suggestions?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
update:&lt;br/&gt;
i found the name of the software i need.&lt;br/&gt;
I am looking for a copy of terralogicus or astrologicus. both are world&lt;br /&gt;
generation/simulation programs from logicrucible. They run in DOS. The&lt;br /&gt;
company is now defunct, so i can&#039;t get it there. Please help! Anybody&lt;br /&gt;
got it lying around for download?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
TIA&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The problem is not so much one of game world economics as a problem of player economics. How can I measure and express the value of game items for characters from one culture interacting with another? For example, could a middle-class pre-Roman Celt afford a Mauser rifle from a Victorian Britishman, and if so would it be an out-of-pocket expense, or something like a year&#039;s earnings? What standard of living could a Mayan god-king afford if vacationing in Feudal Japan? (I&#039;m not actually using these cultures, but they serve as convenient analogues.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How would you handle this, or how have you seen this handled in other systems?                    </content>

What people, places or things come to mind as you see the names? A couple of examples I&#039;ve already got:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trinity College at the University of Toronto - One of the oldest buildings in the Learning Lands, Trinity Below is the home of The Three, no one speaks of them much and whenever they&#039;re mentioned it&#039;s with a sort of awed (or fearful?) reverence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Queen&#039;s Park - The seat of Government in Toronto Below, at least that&#039;s what the Queen would have you believe. She is the mistress of all under her domain, but Queen&#039;s Park isn&#039;t exactly big...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So here&#039;s the list:&lt;br /&gt;
Kensington Market&lt;br /&gt;
St. Lawrence Market&lt;br /&gt;
Eaton Centre&lt;br /&gt;
Hudson&#039;s Bay Company&lt;br /&gt;
CN Tower&lt;br /&gt;
SkyDome&lt;br /&gt;
Maple Leaf Gardens&lt;br /&gt;
The Gay Village&lt;br /&gt;
The Junction&lt;br /&gt;
Cabbagetown&lt;br /&gt;
Bloor West Village&lt;br /&gt;
The Annex&lt;br /&gt;
Trinity-Bellwoods&lt;br /&gt;
Toronto Centre Island&lt;br /&gt;
The Beaches&lt;br /&gt;

Keep in mind that these can be as anachronistic and weird as you like, as time is a funny thing in the &#039;Belows&#039; but that it&#039;s still a magical realm of lost and discarded things populated by the homeless. Even the richest of the Below-folk are still the poorest of the Above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
First matter of discussion: What is one of your favorite genres for a setting that you think has been severely forgotten?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ll give you an example: Time Travel Science Fiction. It&#039;s a hard setting to do well, and so we haven&#039;t seen many examples of it.&lt;br /&gt;
