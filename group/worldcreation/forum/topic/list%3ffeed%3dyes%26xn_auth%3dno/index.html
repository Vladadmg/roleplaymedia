                        Hello world builders! I&#039;m preparing a campaign based on a Neverwhere (book by Neil Gaiman) setting, but as my players and I are Canadian and live in/around Toronto I&#039;m building a Toronto Below. However building an entire Below is proving to be a rather daunting challenge and so I turn to you all for help. I&#039;ve got a list of Toronto Locations/Attractions/Monuments below. What people, places or things come to mind as you see the names? A couple of examples I&#039;ve already got:&lt;br /&gt;

                        Hello world builders! I&#039;m preparing a campaign based on a Neverwhere (book by Neil Gaiman) setting, but as my players and I are Canadian and live in/around Toronto I&#039;m building a Toronto Below. However building an entire Below is proving to be a rather daunting challenge and so I turn to you all for help. I&#039;ve got a list of Toronto Locations/Attractions/Monuments below. What people, places or things come to mind as you see the names? A couple of examples I&#039;ve already got:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trinity College at the University of Toronto - One of the oldest buildings in the Learning Lands, Trinity Below is the home of The Three, no one speaks of them much and whenever they&#039;re mentioned it&#039;s with a sort of awed (or fearful?) reverence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Queen&#039;s Park - The seat of Government in Toronto Below, at least that&#039;s what the Queen would have you believe. She is the mistress of all under her domain, but Queen&#039;s Park isn&#039;t exactly big...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So here&#039;s the list:&lt;br /&gt;
Kensington Market&lt;br /&gt;
St. Lawrence Market&lt;br /&gt;
Eaton Centre&lt;br /&gt;
Hudson&#039;s Bay Company&lt;br /&gt;
CN Tower&lt;br /&gt;
SkyDome&lt;br /&gt;
Maple Leaf Gardens&lt;br /&gt;
The Gay Village&lt;br /&gt;
The Junction&lt;br /&gt;
Cabbagetown&lt;br /&gt;
Bloor West Village&lt;br /&gt;
The Annex&lt;br /&gt;
Trinity-Bellwoods&lt;br /&gt;
Toronto Centre Island&lt;br /&gt;
The Beaches&lt;br /&gt;
Humber River&lt;br /&gt;
Riverdale&lt;br /&gt;
Liberty Village&lt;br /&gt;
Mirvish Village&lt;br /&gt;
High Park&lt;br /&gt;
Casa Loma&lt;br /&gt;
Wychwood Park&lt;br /&gt;
Exhibition Place&lt;br /&gt;
Royal Ontario Museum&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keep in mind that these can be as anachronistic and weird as you like, as time is a funny thing in the &#039;Belows&#039; but that it&#039;s still a magical realm of lost and discarded things populated by the homeless. Even the richest of the Below-folk are still the poorest of the Above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;

                        Hello everyone!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First matter of discussion: What is one of your favorite genres for a setting that you think has been severely forgotten?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ll give you an example: Time Travel Science Fiction. It&#039;s a hard setting to do well, and so we haven&#039;t seen many examples of it.&lt;br /&gt;
