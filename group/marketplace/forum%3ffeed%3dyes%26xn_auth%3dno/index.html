This is a paid gig: $50 for the batch, plus copies of all the products when released for Pathfinder (and honestly, if there&#039;s something else from my catalog that you&#039;d like, I&#039;d be happy to throw it in as well).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let me stress this again: I need an ace in Pathfinder. I want these products to work with Pathfinder because they were rebuilt with it in mind, not just because they are 3.5 and thus compatible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you are interested, reply to this thread and tell me a bit about why you&#039;d be awesome for this gig.                    </content>

                        I have a number of gaming books that I have no interest in keeping anymore, and am therefore offering them up for sale. I will list my books with the MSRP, but my general practice when unloading old gaming books is to charge about 50% plus shipping, though I sometimes throw in a little further discount if a large number of books are requested. So on to the list!&lt;br /&gt;

Note: My copies of the Basic Set books are 1st printings. They have not fallen apart as I heard many from the first batch did, though I can definitely see the &quot;weak stitch&quot; areas when I flip through the book. Just because they didn&#039;t fall apart on me(I used them quite a bit before getting burned out on GURPS), I can&#039;t guarantee they&#039;ll hold out forever. If you buy those two books, please keep in mind that you&#039;re taking some amount of risk. I just thought I should be up front about that.&lt;br /&gt;

A wise Ikanoi warrior who triumphed over the arctic wastes before earning the right to call herself a fighter? Or could be be possible that you were once a ruthless, deadly member of the Daikort Pack, sworn to pledge your blade at your comrades&#039; call forever more?&lt;br /&gt;
