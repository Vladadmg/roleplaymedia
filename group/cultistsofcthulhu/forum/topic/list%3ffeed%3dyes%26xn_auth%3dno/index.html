                        There&#039;s been a long stretch of excitement ever since Reality Blurs &lt;a href=&quot;http://realityblurs.com/wordpress/?page_id=911&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; Realms of Cthulhu for Savage Worlds, and now the wait is over.

Reality Blurs President Sean Preston takes some time to answer a few personal questions and fill us in on some of his ideas and perspectives on the design, development, and play of this new Savage Worlds setting based on H.P. Lovecraft&#039;s Cthulhu mythos. I tried to ask the questions I thought might be stirring in the maddened minds of those who are still undecided about this product. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thediceoflife.com/2009/11/interview-sean-preston-on-realms-of_24.html#more&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read on&lt;/a&gt; to see what Sean has to say.                    </content>
