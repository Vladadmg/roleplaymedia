                        Hey, thanks for creating this group! I was hoping we&#039;d get a good group soon, eh?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here in Montreal, we have several different communities, but the biggest one is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midnightslair.com/forum/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Midnight&#039;s Lair,&lt;/a&gt; a forum started by Erik Menard and Luc Millette, who are the hosts of the podcast of the same name.

Here in Montreal, we have several different communities, but the biggest one is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midnightslair.com/forum/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Midnight&#039;s Lair,&lt;/a&gt; a forum started by Erik Menard and Luc Millette, who are the hosts of the podcast of the same name. They have podfaded somewhat (but haven&#039;t given up entirely) but the forum is thriving. We have a lot of great discussion, but more importantly, we organize tons of one-shots and get campaigns off the ground. A lot of us are system junkies with Corvus Disorder, so we are always excited to try something new. So it&#039;s pretty easy to say &quot;I just bought X and have a cool idea for an adventure. Who wants to play?&quot; and get a bunch of players.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The members of Midnight&#039;s Lair also work closely with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.draconismontreal.ca/index.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Draconis&lt;/a&gt;, our local convention. It takes place in the fall, usually October and we just had year 4. It&#039;s a relatively humble affair, with around 200 gamers, but the quality is good and we are looking to grow. The potential is there! This year was very exciting because we get a small squad of game designers from New England who came up: Vincent Baker, Joshua A.C. Newman, Robert Bohl and Origins-Award winner Luke Crane. Now all of us here have our noses buried in Burning Wheel. These conventions really help energize our gaming!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hey, and if any of you live near Montreal or are going to be travelling through, please don&#039;t hesitate to contact us. We are a friendly bunch and are always happy to invite a new gamer into our community or throw down some dice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
