                        Howdy Folks,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have a project I&#039;m working on that is a compilation of cryptozoological creatures to drop into a campaign. Of course I&#039;d like to make this as widely applicable as possible so I&#039;d like it to be system neutral or easily convertible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So does anybody have any suggestions for example products that do this well?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eventually I&#039;d like to release this as a free pdf.                    </summary>

                        Thought I&#039;d start off with a basic question--which iteration of D&amp;amp;D or its clones &amp;amp; cousins are you playing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Right now, I&#039;m currently playing an old school &quot;cousin&quot;--Castles &amp;amp; Crusades. Our new biweekly game is going quite well, and C&amp;amp;C is providing a nice meeting ground and melting pot for our players.&lt;br /&gt;
