                        One of the things I have struggled with is getting press for Rogue Games. James and I&#039;ve done interviews, keep the news sites informed as to what is going on, and send review copies. The question I have is a simple one: how do you get heard above it all?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Personally, I find this type of work distracting, because it takes me away from the design and writing. However, press helps keep gamers informed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thoughts, advice and ideas are welcomed. What can we learn from each other?                    </summary>

                        Hi folks, WJ here of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.happybishopgames.com/&quot;&gt;Happy Bishop Games&lt;/a&gt;. In my opinion, and tell me if you think I&#039;m wrong, a great way to get publicity, attention, and sales is through reviews. Be it posting here, rpg.net, or on podcasts, reviews explain your product to people who might not have heard of your game otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I suggest we pool our efforts and review each other&#039;s games, then post reviews online. I am not talking about logrolling! I&#039;m talking honest reviews, good o&amp;hellip;                    </summary>

                        Hi folks, WJ here of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.happybishopgames.com/&quot;&gt;Happy Bishop Games&lt;/a&gt;.

Be it posting here, rpg.net, or on podcasts, reviews explain your product to people who might not have heard of your game otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I suggest we pool our efforts and review each other&#039;s games, then post reviews online. I am not talking about logrolling! I&#039;m talking honest reviews, good or bad as the case may be. For example, I could write a review of For Her Majesty&#039;s Arcane Service by Flying Mice Games. I&#039;d post it here and other places, giving them some decent exposure. They could review a Happy Bishop Games product in return, or not. Reciprocation wouldn&#039;t be a requirement but would be encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, let me be clear: I&#039;m NOT looking for fluff reviews to drive sales up. All reviews should be honest--let us allow our products to speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

                        I know several of the publishers we have in this group, but I thought it might be cool to do a little introduction--link to your site, a short explanation of some of your titles, and perhaps what you&#039;re working on!&lt;br /&gt;

Right now, this is the biggest group on this fledgling network!! Huzzah!                    </summary>

                        So, I dunno about you guys, but I&#039;m already ready for another Small Press Week on… whatever becomes of the RPGBN (including this). There&#039;s one company that I forgot about, which makes me feel very guilty, and another that I really want to write about. Of course, I could write these whenever I feel like it, but it can&#039;t hurt to have a little cross-linking going on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here&#039;s what I want to see if we do another SPW:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Better Cross-linking.&lt;/b&gt; I didn&#039;t link to anyone, really (except Zach on my Epi&amp;hellip;                    </summary>

&lt;b&gt;Better Cross-linking.&lt;/b&gt; I didn&#039;t link to anyone, really (except Zach on my Epic RPG interview-thingy), so I&#039;m just as guilty of this as anyone else (except, once again Zach), but I would love if we could set up some super-intense cross-linking system before SPW actually happened.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;More people participating.&lt;/b&gt; I realize this really isn&#039;t something we can control, but I want to see if we can get everyone participating in SPW v2.0 (listening to Wootstock 1.1, so I can&#039;t help but attach version numbers of everything v2.0).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Something filler here.&lt;/b&gt; Because longer lists look better than shorter lists..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Try to avoid scheduling it the same week as a huge RPG Bloggers controversy.&lt;/b&gt; Just sayin&#039; ;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, can we do it? YES WE CAN!                    </content>
