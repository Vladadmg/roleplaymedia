                        I like the verbose stat blocks as one finds them in published &lt;i&gt;C&amp;amp;C&lt;/i&gt; products. They are descriptions more than lists; thus, they inspire a certain feel that a more concise stat block lacks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Too bad they&#039;re a pain to refer to during play.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am exploring some options that combine the two -- to retain the descriptive manner while still being more to-the-point.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But how do YOU do it?                    </summary>

                        Do any of you guys or gals read The Crusader? I&#039;ve got one issue and liked it for the most part. There was a dungeon level in the center which was neat but the editing is pretty horrible.                    </summary>
