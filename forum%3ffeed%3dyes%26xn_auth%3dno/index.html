Just for reference, is it acceptable to ask people to leave comments at your own website rather then on here? It does seem rude to me, but I&#039;d like to keep feedback in one place.                    </summary>

                        I have an idea about a way to do a blog aggregator. Just an idea, I&#039;ll let the more technically knowledgeable people fact check this for viability.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Google Alerts (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/alerts&quot;&gt;http://www.google.com/alerts&lt;/a&gt;) can be set up to search blogs for keywords, and send you alerts by email, in Google Reader, or via an RSS feed. It gives you code for an RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
People who want to have blog posts appear on The Feed add the keyword to the blog post somehow, so Google picks up on it. It has to be a unique keyword. I suggest &quot;rpmnfeed&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People who want to host the feed can just paste in the RSS code on a web page. Then The Feed will be available in multiple places. Or, you can receive the feed in any way Google Alerts serves it up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the event of spammers, we change the keyword.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No hosting required. No moderation required. It&#039;s distributed and open. And it should be relatively simple to execute... if it works.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, I need to find Java or Flash RSS code that works on a Ning page. Ning&#039;s native RSS limits the number of articles served.                    </content>

                        Tagging really helps others to find related content, and with the amount of content in this network, they&#039;re almost needed. It also allows one to grab a feed of items with a particular tag.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With that said, I personally would be extremely appreciative if others tag their posts in blogs and discussions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another tip: Ning automatically separates words with spaces as two different tags. If you want to tag something with a phrase such as &lt;i&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/i&gt;, put it in quotes like &quot;Savage Worlds&quot; o&amp;hellip;                    </summary>

It&#039;s played on a wiki and the idea is that every turn you create an entry in the wiki (going through the alphabet one letter at a time) and cite other entries, which 1)cannot be ones you&#039;ve written and 2) must be phantom entries when possible (that&amp;hellip;                    </summary>

&lt;br /&gt;
Here&#039;s the elevator pitch and the website where the idea was first published:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The basic idea is that each player takes on the role of a scholar, from before scholarly pursuits became professionalized (or possibly after they ceased to be). You are cranky, opinionated, prejudiced and eccentric. You are also collaborating with a number of your peers -- the other players -- on the construction of an encyclopedia describing some historical period (possibly of a fantastic world).&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone interested in playing? To keep it interesting, I&#039;d be looking to recruit players from multiple places and encourage you to forward this along to anyone you think might be interested.&lt;br /&gt;
We&#039;ve got enough to play, but still want more.&lt;br /&gt;

I like dinosaurs as much as the next person (well, maybe a bit more), but I&#039;ve had a growing fascination for some years with creatures from times before them. Lately I&#039;ve found myself thinking what it would be like to have modern people interact with the incredibly ancient worlds of the Permian or early Triassic. Few people learn about these earlier periods, so they would be a lot more exotic. Instead of dinosaurs, dimetrodons and dicynodonts! What if a group of modern people, knowledgeable and well-equipped enough to survive, somehow ended up stranded hundreds of millions of years in the past on the continent of Pangaea? How would they adapt? What kind of adventure could be had -- exploration? A race to try to redevelop technology? The apocalypse of the Permian-Triassic extinction that wiped out almost all life on Earth?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is just one of the crazy things floating around in the back of my mind. What about you folks?                    </content>
