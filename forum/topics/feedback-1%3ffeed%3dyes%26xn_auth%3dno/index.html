                        Regarding the &#039;useless&#039; bits on your personal page, you can shuffle things between the left and center columns as well as top to bottom.

The first thing I do when going into chat (after doing a quick scan) it to click the clear button (the word balloon with the X in it) to get all the old stuff out. You can also select a user and create a private chat room, if you want to filter the noise.&lt;br /&gt;

Perhaps I&#039;m doing something wrong (or just haven&#039;t stumbled across the right filters yet) but when one enters the chat room it seems to show everyone online as if they were also in the chat room, even if they&#039;re not. Which means, for example, there may be 18 people listed, but only two who are actively using the chat function...&lt;br/&gt; Is there a filter/feature I should be using that will allow only the folks who are actively using the chat function to show up as &quot;in the chat&quot;?&lt;/div&gt;
