                        I personally operate with 2 principles:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1) You can only lead where people are willing to follow. If you don&#039;t lead, no one follows anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Treat people like adults if you expect them to act like adults. Someone treated like a child is more likely to act like one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can&#039;t say as I&#039;m perfect but as Berin says, if I goof I&#039;ll fix it ASAP and learn from it.                    </summary>
