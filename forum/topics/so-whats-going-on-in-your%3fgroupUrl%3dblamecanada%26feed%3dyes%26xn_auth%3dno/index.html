I&#039;m in the Peterborough, Ontario region. Specifically the island of academia known as Trent University. While there appears to be a solid gaming core in Peterborough (present enough to have a local convention) I haven&#039;t found any concrete information on public groups, which means that the only public group I know of is me. I run public sanctioned RPGA games once a month as my schedule permits, but for most of my gaming needs I either hit up my private group or scoot on down to Toronto.                    </summary>

                        Hi everyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m in Ontario below Hamilton and just off of the Lake Erie shore. There is not much going on at all game-wise in this region. Still I call it home. Most of the contact I have with other gamers is online. It&#039;s both a blessing and a curse. You can game with people from all over the country and the world, but sometimes it is slow going doing it that way.                    </summary>

The organization also works with other gaming groups, business partners and individual players to support the gaming community.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m not an active member of this group because of time constraints (work, family and Grand OGL Wiki). I have my own friend group that is playing Pathfinder and a Play-By-Email group that also plays.                    </content>
