&lt;div&gt;But the overall activity is pretty low considering this network is over 600 members strong. That&#039;s why I (with support of Berin, of course) want to try to make the network cool and interesting again. Some friends and I have been throwing a couple of ideas around, and if everything works as planned, you&#039;ll see some cool new things around here soon. If you have some ideas yourself, please let me know. Any help is highly appreciated!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In order to show that things are moving again, I changed the appearance of the site and enabled a feature that allows new and existing users to sign in using their Google and Yahoo credentials. This should make things a bit more comfortable for some of you. I&#039;ll try to enable the Facebook login feature later.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But of course all this will not help without you, our members. That&#039;s why I wholeheartedly invite you to make the RPMN your own. Use it in the way it suits you best. We&#039;ll try to help you with this in any way possible. Welcome back to the RPMN and enjoy your stay!&lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;First, what you want to hear: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://roleplaymedia.net/&quot;&gt;Role Play Media Network&lt;/a&gt; will survive the July 20th Ning-pocalypse intact.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d like to apologize for keeping everyone in suspense about this, but we didn&#039;t know ourselves until this morning. RPMN is an asset of UncleBear Media LLC. Because we&#039;re just…&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d like to apologize for keeping everyone in suspense about this, but we didn&#039;t know ourselves until this morning. RPMN is an asset of UncleBear Media LLC. Because we&#039;re just starting up and we have our fingers in so many pies, from RPG publishing to producing an indie film to possibly toy manufacturing (is that not public information yet? Oops.), our focus is understandably on stuff that makes money. The Ning bombshell blew a hole in our production schedule; we have plans for RPMN, but &lt;i&gt;not just yet&lt;/i&gt;. We discussed ways to monetize it, but we&#039;re not happy with those. I, personally, am not happy with those. I want it to be its own thing, not an UncleBear house organ. We could sell more advertising, there are various paid services we could add, we could beg for donations, but in the end we&#039;re just going to underwrite it for now and figure out ways to make it financially self-sustaining later. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do want to help, what the Role Play Media Network really needs is fresh meat for the Brute Squad. We need more moderators to approve members and bring the banhammer down on spammers. The automated anti-spam tools work great, mind you, but clever people manager to get around it from time to time and need to be dealt with. There&#039;s a thread on the RPMN forum where we&#039;re recruiting. If you want to chip in a few bucks for costs, there&#039;s also a donation tab, but we&#039;re not actively begging for cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the future... stay tuned. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </content>

I&#039;d love to hear folks&#039; insight into the feasibility of this type of fiction marketing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;m also actively seeking opportunities to talk about the Patronage model for directly-marketed fiction, so if anyone has a blog or podcast (or knows of one that this might be a good fit for) and is interested in having a guest on to talk about this (along with gaming - I&#039;ve got several other directly game-related projects that have either just released or will be releasing soon) please feel free to drop me a note at: jess@jesshartley.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;~jess hartley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.jesshartley.com&quot;&gt;www.jesshartley.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                    </content>
