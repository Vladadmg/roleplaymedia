    <meta name="description" content="In my first post about finding a good gaming group, I gave some general advice on how to approach the whole process. In this post, I will give some more concrete, specific steps you can take.

Cast the net wide!
To preface these tips, I'd like to say that you are probably aware of at least some of them and may well have tried them before. Gamers are an elusive, shy lot and you there are many avenues of communication. So you must use a blanket approach, using as many channels of communication as possible. Think of it like fishing. You have to hit as many spots as possible to increase your chances of getting a hit.


TO THE INTERNET!
For all these sites, it is helpful to be as explicit as possible about your preferred games. Oftentimes, someone in your region may be looking for players for a specific campaign and they will do a search for the name of that game.

Nearby Gamers - a bit quiet these days, but still very helpful to see who plays what in your region. I wish more people would use this service, actually.

Roleplayers Meetup.com - this is only useful if there is a group in your area. If not, maybe you can start one! It also has the more specific D&amp;amp;D Meetup.com, though these groups often include more than just D&amp;amp;D.

Pen &amp;amp; Paper Games Player Registry - I actually just discovered this and there appears to be nobody in Montreal listed (thus reinforcing my point about casting the net wide), but it has an excellent set of search criteria and appears to be quite active, with people signing up daily. Give it a try!

RPG.NET - They have a Gamer Gatherings sub-forum, that is an excellent resource, but I find it is much more effective to add to your signature that you are looking for other gamers and then participate in discussions concerning the games you are interested in. If you aren't the forum kind, then just lurk in those areas and keep a close look at the location field in interesting poster's heading. If someone seems interesting and in your region, PM them. Two of the players in my current group I met this way.

Game-specific fora and discussion groups - I can not think of a game or at least a company that doesn't have its own forum for online discussion. Whether it's GURPS or Savage Worlds or Burning Wheel, there is a forum where you can go and talk about that game. Even the smaller games like Cartoon Action Hour, Barbarians of Lemuria or BASH have their own Yahoo or Google groups. I met my first gaming group here in Montreal through the SJGames forums, as GURPS was my game of choice at the time.

Local gaming community websites or forums - This varies from region to region, but it is at least worth a google search for the name of your town and RPGs. Here in Montreal, Midnight's Lair is where you go if you want to find out about the local gaming scene. The Vancouver Gaming Guild has a very active Games/Players Wanted sub-forum. Sometimes it may take a bit of hunting to find the site that is still active, as many are started but not all survive and you'll find many that are just empty shells, sad reminders of gaming past.

Your local (friendly or not) game store forums - I have had the least amount of luck with these. The attention that most game stores pay to their forums tends to be about as good as the average level of customer service at most game stores i.e. pretty piss-poor. But there are some really active ones out there and maybe you are lucky enough to live in a town with a good game store. And even the really dead ones do get people checking in every now and then so it doesn't hurt to put up a post there.

(since you are already here reading this, I won't say more than that the Role Play Media Network seems like an awesome place to meet gamers in your area. I look forward to it growing.)

                                    In my <a href="http://www.roleplaymedia.net/profiles/blogs/advice-for-those-of-you-who" target="_blank">first post about finding a good gaming group</a>, I gave some general advice on how to approach the whole process. In this post, I will give some more concrete, specific steps you can take.<br />
<br />
<b>Cast the net wide!</b><br />
To preface these tips, I'd like to say that you are probably aware of at least some of them and may well have tried them before. Gamers are an elusive, shy lot and you there are many avenues of communication. So you must use a blanket approach, using as many channels of communication as possible. Think of it like fishing. You have to hit as many spots as possible to increase your chances of getting a hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>TO THE INTERNET!</b><br />
For all these sites, it is helpful to be as explicit as possible about your preferred games. Oftentimes, someone in your region may be looking for players for a specific campaign and they will do a search for the name of that game.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nearbygamers.com/" target="_blank"><b>Nearby Gamers</b></a> - a bit quiet these days, but still very helpful to see who plays what in your region. I wish more people would use this service, actually.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://roleplayers.meetup.com/" target="_blank"><b>Roleplayers Meetup.com</b></a> - this is only useful if there is a group in your area. If not, maybe you can start one! It also has the more specific <a href="http://dnd.meetup.com/" target="_blank">D&amp;D Meetup.com</a>, though these groups often include more than just D&amp;D.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.penandpapergames.com/forums/memberlist.php?s=4ad41a402409949a588393e917f4fe2d" target="_blank"><b>Pen &amp; Paper Games Player Registry</b></a> - I actually just discovered this and there appears to be nobody in Montreal listed (thus reinforcing my point about casting the net wide), but it has an excellent set of search criteria and appears to be quite active, with people signing up daily. Give it a try!<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.rpg.net/" target="_blank"><b>RPG.NET</b></a> - They have a <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/forumdisplay.php?f=21" target="_blank">Gamer Gatherings sub-forum</a>, that is an excellent resource, but I find it is much more effective to add to your signature that you are looking for other gamers and then participate in discussions concerning the games you are interested in. If you aren't the forum kind, then just lurk in those areas and keep a close look at the location field in interesting poster's heading. If someone seems interesting and in your region, PM them. Two of the players in my current group I met this way.<br />
<br />
<b>Game-specific fora and discussion groups</b> - I can not think of a game or at least a company that doesn't have its own forum for online discussion. Whether it's GURPS or Savage Worlds or Burning Wheel, there is a forum where you can go and talk about that game. Even the smaller games like Cartoon Action Hour, <a href="http://www.roleplaymedia.net/profiles/blogs/an-interview-with-barbarians" target="_blank">Barbarians of Lemuria</a> or BASH have their own Yahoo or Google groups. I met my first gaming group here in Montreal through the SJGames forums, as GURPS was my game of choice at the time.<br />
<br />
<b>Local gaming community websites or forums</b> - This varies from region to region, but it is at least worth a google search for the name of your town and RPGs.

<br />
(since you are already here reading this, I won't say more than that the Role Play Media Network seems like an awesome place to meet gamers in your area. I look forward to it growing.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>MEATSPACE</b><br />
<br />
<b>Your Local Gaming Store</b> - If you are lucky enough to have a good gaming store in your town, go there and hang out! Chat with the employees, let it be known you are looking for a group. Good games stores have play events ranging from special game days to ongoing drop-in games. Even if it's a closed group, ask if you can just sit and observe. If you are really ambitious, you can offer to run your own game.<br />
<br />
<b>Local Conventions</b> - Sadly, often it is up to the participants to seek out local conventions. The organizers may not have the budget or the experience to be able to properly publicize their event. There may be a small con in your hometown and you don't even know it! Look for it and go. Enough said.<br />
<br />
<b>In public</b> - Don't be shy. Read your gaming books on the train, in a café, while on break. You never know where another gamer may be hiding. True story: when I first started teaching, was at the photocopier in the teacher's lounge and somebody had left their original on the platten. I picked it up and it turned out to be a character sheet for 3rd edition D&amp;D. At that point, I had left gaming behind me in grade 7 and hadn't played or even really thought about RPG's for almost 15 years. But that sheet piqued my interest and I stuck it in my bag. A few days later, another teacher with whom I was already thinking was kind of cool started talking to me about D&amp;D and how he had a game going. He invited me to it and the rest was history. Turns out he was deliberately planting the character sheet there and spying on who would pick it up. A brilliant gamer trap!<br />
<br />
<b>Recruitment</b> - Converting existing acquaintances to gaming is a corollary to being public about your gaming. You may find people who have only played computer games or are big fantasy fans but have never gamed asking you about the book you are reading. It's something I've never tried but have heard many other people having success with it, especially in the indie community where the games are quick to learn and the subject matter much more varied. It's a subject for its own post, best done by someone with actual experience in the field.<br />
<br />
So that's a pretty exhaustive list. I hope some of you find it helpful. I'm sure that it is not complete, so if any of you have other resources, websites and suggestions in general, I welcome them here.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting, lonely gamers!<br />

                                I had an interesting "In public" moment. At my college, most of the professors spend the first day on introductions. So my "something about yourself" was basically that I was a big geek. Anime, sci-fi, fantasy literature, RPGs, if it's geeky I probably like it. And it turned out a couple people in the class also had geekish tendencies, and I wouldn't have found that out if I hadn't spoken out like I did. One of them actually introduced me to her brother, and now I play in a weekly D&amp;D 3.5 game that he DMs. And that's my story!            </dd>
