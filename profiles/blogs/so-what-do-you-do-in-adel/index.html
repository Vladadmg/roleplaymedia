    <meta name="description" content="This might be the first Spirits of Eden module. I guess. I don't really know what to call it. Is it an adventure or is it an outline? But it's here. It even has a couple of encounters.

I thought that my Spirits of Eden campaign setting, for a long time, has kind of perplexed people. You sort of  know  the kinds of adventures you play in regular D&amp;amp;D worlds. In Eberron everyone says you can have fights on top of a train (and that indeed the train is there SOLELY so you can have fights on it) and in Forgotten Realms there's beating up kobolds and goblins like there's always been. But when a setting like mine comes along that says  humanity and elves and halflings are all nearly extinct, the lands are mostly peaceful now that they're pretty much gone, goblins and kobolds and orcs are completely crushed and beaten and not a threat, and oh yeah there's all these god-like beings walking around everywhere who never use their full powers when mortals are around  then your response is  huh? 

What I set out to do when writing Eden was to remove that familiarity. That familiarity was stale to me. I'm tired of kobold-filled caverns, and of dark, dreary lands where evil is afoot everywhere, and of distant gods who still demand your worship in exchange for magic, and of humans and elves and the like dominating. But I realize that, once those things are removed and there's a new order, people think  well, it's still D&amp;amp;D 4e as far as I'm still beating things up with powers, but what do you guys do around here?  Who's here but us chickens, you ask? That's kind of what this sets out to do in a way. It's still familiar. Farmland threatened by supernatural evil, and there's even a band of goofy bumbling goblins you can beat up. But it's also different, and the ways it is different are what stokes the imagination.

My hope is I can write the three parts of Clouded Palace without being called a horrible hack who deserves to die, and from there I can write other things like the Clouded Palace showing what you do in The Spirits of Eden, and giving content to the community that they can play, so that Eden might actually move on to people's tables (virtual and not) in some way. I've met the criticism that I'm a masturbatory writer – I write powers and feats and things that nobody uses because the Character Builder has destroyed character options outside of Wizard's as viable, and I write these in an intimidating volume (I'm tallying up the entirety of Eden's new character options, and so far I've counted 266 feats, feats alone!). Meanwhile I don't write things  people actually use.  This is sort of an attempt at relevancy.

So is it relevant? Will people use it? Do people even like it? Are people even reading this little spiel on the RPMN? I don't know what to be content with as far as  relevancy  is concerned anymore.

But I know I enjoyed writing this.

(Also if you've noticed, I'm using RPMN to elaborate on the meta stuff about writing posts on my blog. I figure that's a good use of this space without rehashing the same posts from Spirits of Eden.)" />
