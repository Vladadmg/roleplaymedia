    <meta name="description" content="This is my first time blogging, and it's mostly, I guess, just to gather my thoughts on the horror game I want to try and run. I've been trying to plan to run a horror game ever since Rincon in the beginning of October. I got really interested in the idea for some reason, and since I wanted to get into GMing anyway, but I'm stubborn and want to do something none of my friends have done, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Unfortunately, I have found quite a few road blocks and bumps along the way of coming up with this game. First of all, let me start by saying that I find myself realizing more and more that I don't really like many RPG systems at all. For whatever reason, I tend to dislike them at a fundamental level, at least something about every single one of them just irks me. Don't get me wrong, I get over my issues and will play just about anything, but these problems seem to become more and more apparent to me when I am trying to plan a game to run in one of these systems.

So originally I was reading nWoD, thinking I could do modern contemporary horror. Now, as I said, I'm not a huge fan of this system (or many systems at all), but it is a system that seems to fall into the background enough that it doesn't bother me much. I was planning on trying to run something in nWoD, but I ran into a few issues. The first and foremost was my lack of creativity and ability to write my own scenarios and campaign ideas. I think, given some time, I'll get better and coming up with my own stuff, but for now, just starting out running games, I'm not that good at it. The Second problem came when I pitched this idea to my group and found that I had a person who was completely and utterly opposed to the nWoD system. He suggested I try reading Call of Cthulhu instead.

Now, when I tell you that I'm not a big fan of Call of Cthulhu, I want you to understand where I'm coming from. Don't get me wrong, I love H.P. Lovecraft. Horror is probably my favorite genre for fiction, and he is the king to be sure. My main issues with Call come from the now aged system. The skill system feels unrewarding to a child of new age role playing, and the sheer uselessness of combat stats for half the creatures in the book based on how impossible fighting them is just leaves me at a loss. Also, despite the fact that I am looking for a certain level of mortality and realistic danger, CoC is a little too harsh on investigators and a little too lethal in my opinion. I guess the other thing though is that I've never actually played it, so I only know what it looks like to me on paper, and admittedly, the audio games that Paul of Cthulhu and the Bradford players have put on over at Yog-Sothoth.com definitely make the game sound like it doesn't suffer at all from any of what I perceive as it's shortcomings, so I reserve judgment for when I actually try it in person. In my defense, I love Cthulhu for the use it intends, but if I have intentions of running anything not mythos related I think I'm better off going a different direction. I think I'm also a bit bias because anytime I try and pitch anything horror related it always falls back to the theory that the only horror game on the planet it CoC. I have a natural distaste for the spotlight that entails.

There are quite a few positive things about the idea of running CoC though. I simply love the writing for the game, the books and supplements that are out for the game are fantastic, and definitely promote a certain excitement to play the game that is entirely undeniable. This leads me to feel that no matter how many issues I have with the system, I still want to run the game, which when you are someone like me, who is never happy with a system, this is a good thing. Another great thing is the fact that I could run CoC for years and never have to come up with my own campaigns or scenarios. There is an exhaustive amount of campaigns, scenarios, and supplements out there for Call, all I have to do is get my handsâ€¦" />

                                    This is my first time blogging, and it's mostly, I guess, just to gather my thoughts on the horror game I want to try and run. I've been trying to plan to run a horror game ever since Rincon in the beginning of October. I got really interested in the idea for some reason, and since I wanted to get into GMing anyway, but I'm stubborn and want to do something none of my friends have done, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Unfortunately, I have found quite a few road blocks and bumps along the way of coming up with this game. First of all, let me start by saying that I find myself realizing more and more that I don't really like many RPG systems at all. For whatever reason, I tend to dislike them at a fundamental level, at least something about every single one of them just irks me. Don't get me wrong, I get over my issues and will play just about anything, but these problems seem to become more and more apparent to me when I am trying to plan a game to run in one of these systems.<br />
<br />
So originally I was reading nWoD, thinking I could do modern contemporary horror. Now, as I said, I'm not a huge fan of this system (or many systems at all), but it is a system that seems to fall into the background enough that it doesn't bother me much.

The Second problem came when I pitched this idea to my group and found that I had a person who was completely and utterly opposed to the nWoD system. He suggested I try reading Call of Cthulhu instead.<br />
<br />
Now, when I tell you that I'm not a big fan of Call of Cthulhu, I want you to understand where I'm coming from. Don't get me wrong, I love H.P. Lovecraft. Horror is probably my favorite genre for fiction, and he is the king to be sure. My main issues with Call come from the now aged system. The skill system feels unrewarding to a child of new age role playing, and the sheer uselessness of combat stats for half the creatures in the book based on how impossible fighting them is just leaves me at a loss. Also, despite the fact that I am looking for a certain level of mortality and realistic danger, CoC is a little too harsh on investigators and a little too lethal in my opinion. I guess the other thing though is that I've never actually played it, so I only know what it looks like to me on paper, and admittedly, the audio games that Paul of Cthulhu and the Bradford players have put on over at Yog-Sothoth.com definitely make the game sound like it doesn't suffer at all from any of what I perceive as it's shortcomings, so I reserve judgment for when I actually try it in person. In my defense, I love Cthulhu for the use it intends, but if I have intentions of running anything not mythos related I think I'm better off going a different direction. I think I'm also a bit bias because anytime I try and pitch anything horror related it always falls back to the theory that the only horror game on the planet it CoC. I have a natural distaste for the spotlight that entails.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few positive things about the idea of running CoC though. I simply love the writing for the game, the books and supplements that are out for the game are fantastic, and definitely promote a certain excitement to play the game that is entirely undeniable. This leads me to feel that no matter how many issues I have with the system, I still want to run the game, which when you are someone like me, who is never happy with a system, this is a good thing. Another great thing is the fact that I could run CoC for years and never have to come up with my own campaigns or scenarios. There is an exhaustive amount of campaigns, scenarios, and supplements out there for Call, all I have to do is get my hands on them. This fixes my problem of not being able to come up with my own stuff quite nicely. Also, as I said, I'm a big fan of the Cthulhu Mythos, so gearing my brain to run a mythos game instead of just a contemporary horror game is not hard for me to do. With this in mind, I've decided CoC is my best course of action, despite previously stated problems.<br />
<br />
So next, I had to tackle the idea of trying it in a different system. I considered this, and looked into my options. Of course the first and foremost option, and easiest because all the pre-written things I'm looking at are already written for it, is the classic, tried and true, Chaosium's own BRP Call of Cthulhu. This is the main choice, and the one that would be simplest because I wouldn't have to convert scenarios or anything of that sort.<br />
<br />
The next option would be Trail of Cthulhu, which runs under the Gumshoe system. This option I would consider except I don't know the system at all, and if I'm teaching the guys a new system, it might as well be BRP. Besides, I've heard that it doesn't fix the main issue I find with classic CoC, which is the high lethality of the game, and it sounds like the system is a little to system light for me, but again that's just form reading up on it and hearing things second hand.<br />
<br />
The third option is Sean Preston's new savage worlds supplement, Realms of Cthulhu. While this is an interesting idea, it has a few flaws in my opinion. firstly, it is still more pulpy than what I'm looking for, even with it's completely gritty damage and sanity options. Secondly, I have a group that show a natural distaste to the simplicity of character creation in Savage Worlds, so haven't really got past that for the most part. I myself find myself not being a huge fan of the system, but that's no surprise here, and I like the system well enough that I will use it when applicable, and I play in Savage Worlds games gladly.<br />
<br />
So, with all that in mind, that leaves me with the intention to run the classic CoC system. So, that leaves me with the current problem of what I want to run. I want to run a campaign, not just a string of one-shots, so I'm looking into the idea of running a few intro scenarios, then jumping into one of the campaigns. This in and of itself has presented issues, because many of the campaigns I find myself interested in are out of print. With the limitations of which campaigns I can find in mind, I'm thinking about running a couple of the scenarios in the main rulebook, then jumping into Masks of Nyhartlehotep, but I've heard it's not terribly easy for new keepers. In fact, most people have discouraged me from trying to jump into any of the lengthy campaigns, as they are hazardous for new keepers and may lead to discouraging results. I'm thinking that I'm just going to throw my hat in the ring and give it a shot, and hope that my group and I can work our way through any of the pitfalls and problems that might rear there heads because of my inexperience.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, Current tentative plan is something like:<br />
<br />
Edge of Darkness<br />
The Haunting<br />
Masks of Nyartlehotep<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully my group and I can make this work, and if, by the end of the second scenario I feel that I need more practice before we jump into Masks, I can always dig up some more scenarios to try and build more lead up and prep.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for reading through my rambling, I may be back to ramble some more sometime, who knows.<br />
<br />
Until then, just remember, when the stars are right, and the time is late, I may just get bored enough to post again.<br />

                                Yeah, I agree with your assessment, at least from my limited experience of reading the books. Game seems cool, atmosphere seems like a lot of fun, system seems like it could use a re-write. Oh well, I'll take what I can get, looks pretty fun as it is, I just need to give it a shot instead of judging it without playing it.            </dd>

                                BRP Call of Cthulhu is an extremely schizophrenic beast. More than half of the monsters in the main rulebook actually can (and in the adventures, they expect you to) be killed with guns and explosions. Sometimes it takes a lot of guns and explosions, but not beyond the reach of a determined set of player characters. Then once you've learned that monsters can be killed with guns and explosions, the game punishes you for learning what it just taught you by throwing a monster that can't be killed with guns and explosions at you. Then you come to the internet and fans of the game insist that the first set of monsters don't exist at all and you should have known better. Well la dee dah.<br />
<br />
That's not to say there aren't some great things about it. It's fast and intuitive and written with a great deal of love for the genre. The people involved have not just kept the Cthulhu torch burning, but burned down the whole damn forest. But as a system, you're right. It has a lot of problems that could be solved if anyone would ever let the game change. This the aforementioned fans will not permit.            </dd>

                                @Phil: Like I said, I am a fan of Call for what it is intended to do. My issues come in when I try and think of it as anything more combat involved then it is. I am mostly at odds with the character creation and advancement having a lack of customization and options. Now, I'm okay with letting that slide in favor of just role playing and leaving the crunchy bits behind, but in a lot of ways I usually like to be able to have a balance of mechanics and story, plot, and character. The fact of the matter is if I say I don't like a system, it's not that surprising, as I noted earlier in the blog. The fact that I like the subject matter of CoC so much is a boon for the game in my opinion, and as a mentioned, the writing is fantastic, so I'm all in for the most part. I just kind of react poorly when everyone bombards me about there CoC fanaticism. I guess I did choose my words poorly though, I think once I try it, I'll be a fan.            </dd>

                                Thanks for the responses.<br />
<br />
@Tim: I have looked into Don't Rest my Head, I'm interested, but haven't gotten a chance to read or play it. I've played Dread and I like it a lot, in fact I'm planning to run a dread game off of the quick start rules in a couple weeks, but I'm looking for a more campaign oriented game at the moment. I've never heard of My Life with Master, but I'll look into it. Thanks for the heads up on those!            </dd>

                                &gt; I don't really like many RPG systems at all.<br />

You may want to take a look at some less traditional horror roleplaying games, like<br />
Dread ( <a rel=nofollow href="http://www.tiltingatwindmills.net/dread/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.tiltingatwindmills.net/dread/index.html</a> ),<br />
Don't Rest Your Head ( <a rel=nofollow href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/dryh/" target="_blank">http://www.evilhat.com/home/dryh/</a> ), or<br />
My Life With Master ( <a rel=nofollow href="http://halfmeme.com/master.html" target="_blank">http://halfmeme.com/master.html</a> ).            </dd>

                                I HAVE played Call of Cthulhu, and I love it. The reason the stats for most monsters are the way they are is because you're not REALLY supposed to fight most of them, and when you do, things are generally supposed to go bad for the investigators. Come on, you've read Lovecraft's work, right? Fighting evil is mainly about banishing or containing it. The REAL fight in Call of Cthulhu is against the omnipresent threat of insanity brought about by the investigators' ever increasing knowledge of Things Man Was Not Meant To Know. That said, there is occasionally a right time for physical confrontation, which is why stats are presented.<br />
<br />
If you want or need an experienced player. let me know. I'm interested.<br />
