    <meta name="description" content="I like to think about the choices I make, why I make them, and how they compare to the choices and methods of choosing displayed by others. Yesterday I was looking at my collection of RPG's and trying to establish by looking at the history of my purchases where my tastes lie now, where they have been in the past, whether my purchases have been reflective of those tastes (am I satisfied with the things I bought), etc.

Noticing a preference for small press games, I asked myself what I found attractive about these games. Specifically, I wanted to know what I was getting by purchasing small press games, and conversely what I might be missing as a result of not choosing their counterparts.

I came up with two key elements that I like about small press games, which I want to share in a nonjudgmental way. Meaning I am going to write about what I personally think I am getting by purchasing small press games without saying  and you should purchase small press games too.  Hopefully I will explain how each of these elements are a matter of choice and what the effects of the choices are, leaving other gamers better informed to make choices of their own.

COHESIVE VISION
More often than not, small press games are the product of one person's vision, or a collaboration between two or three designers. (Obviously larger press games sometimes, but less commonly, fit this description as well.) The advantage of having only one vision, or a vision closely shared by only a few individuals, is purity and potency. Purity in the sense that the vision isn't being stretched out of shape to include the various ideas or exclude the dislikes of a team of creative individuals. As such, pure visions are often more unique, which also gives them more impact and/or potency. The disadvantage to such a vision is that it may target a narrower audience and can be polarizing. Gamers will either love the game or hate it.

The advantages of the opposite type of game, one that is the creative output of a whole team of designers, is theoretically a more evenly developed and comprehensive product, and also one with more universal appeal. The drawback is that these products are also sometimes less artistically coherent, can be bland, and at worst represent a lowest common denominator. Instead of getting the best ideas from each team member and combining them, sometimes these games are a compromise representing an amalgamation of the bits to which the fewest number of team members objected.

ARTISAN MENTALITY
Small press books often display an artisan's mentality about product. There is something kind of magical about a small press book. Contact with a small press book often sparks a feeling of intimacy, because the books look and feel as if they were (or could have been) made by a person, rather than a printing press. Tell-tale signs of small press books are card stock covers, saddle stitching (which is a fancy word for binding pages together by stapling through the crease) or tape binding, unorthodox or even clunky layouts and fonts, less polished (but not necessarily poor) artwork, etc. All of these are cues that the creator is working without the same resources that a big company might have. While this means the book probably won't hold up as well to long term use, the trade-off is a sense of participation in something special. The buyer of a small press game is really more of a patron. Generally, the creator will recover a greater percentage of the profit and be paid more directly. The buyer of a small press book can assume he will have more direct access to the creator. The buyer can assume he is joining a smaller community, in which his or her voice may carry more weight than it would in the fan base of a large press game.

Sometimes small press books even bear the physical marks of their creators. I have known designers to hand-make covers using various arts-and-crafts techniques, to individually sign and/or number copies, to create alternative covers, etc. The..." />

<b>COHESIVE VISION</b><br />
More often than not, small press games are the product of one person's vision, or a collaboration between two or three designers. (Obviously larger press games sometimes, but less commonly, fit this description as well.) The advantage of having only one vision, or a vision closely shared by only a few individuals, is purity and potency. Purity in the sense that the vision isn't being stretched out of shape to include the various ideas or exclude the dislikes of a team of creative individuals. As such, pure visions are often more unique, which also gives them more impact and/or potency. The disadvantage to such a vision is that it may target a narrower audience and can be polarizing. Gamers will either love the game or hate it.<br />
<br />
The advantages of the opposite type of game, one that is the creative output of a whole team of designers, is theoretically a more evenly developed and comprehensive product, and also one with more universal appeal. The drawback is that these products are also sometimes less artistically coherent, can be bland, and at worst represent a lowest common denominator. Instead of getting the best ideas from each team member and combining them, sometimes these games are a compromise representing an amalgamation of the bits to which the fewest number of team members objected.<br />
<br />
<b>ARTISAN MENTALITY</b><br />
Small press books often display an artisan's mentality about product. There is something kind of magical about a small press book. Contact with a small press book often sparks a feeling of intimacy, because the books look and feel as if they were (or could have been) made by a person, rather than a printing press. Tell-tale signs of small press books are card stock covers, saddle stitching (which is a fancy word for binding pages together by stapling through the crease) or tape binding, unorthodox or even clunky layouts and fonts, less polished (but not necessarily poor) artwork, etc. All of these are cues that the creator is working without the same resources that a big company might have. While this means the book probably won't hold up as well to long term use, the trade-off is a sense of participation in something special. The buyer of a small press game is really more of a patron. Generally, the creator will recover a greater percentage of the profit and be paid more directly. The buyer of a small press book can assume he will have more direct access to the creator. The buyer can assume he is joining a smaller community, in which his or her voice may carry more weight than it would in the fan base of a large press game.<br />
<br />
Sometimes small press books even bear the physical marks of their creators. I have known designers to hand-make covers using various arts-and-crafts techniques, to individually sign and/or number copies, to create alternative covers, etc. These books obviously appeal to the collector mentality that most gamers (and most human beings) have to a greater or lesser degree.<br />
<br />
Large press books generally have the advantages of larger print runs, which can reduce the cost-per-page and/or justify higher quality printing processes. In general, large press books have a more polished feel to them and will last longer. However, just as small press books have observable features that mark them as having been produced on a budget, large press books always look and feel mass-produced. The buyer of a large press book trades off intimacy for a bigger fan base, which means he or she is more likely to be able to find other gamers with the same game. Also, buyers of large press books can assume that some quantity of supporting products are probably in the works or are already on the shelf. (This can be a bad assumption, but generally speaking it is accurate.)<br />
<br />
<b>OTHER</b><br />
Of course these two elements aren't the only reason to choose a small or large press game, but they are certainly two important factors in my own purchasing decisions (aside from other factors that are unrelated to the small or large press format). If you find yourself being swayed by the same factors, even if you make the opposite choices I generally do, take a moment to tell me about it.                </div>

                                Nice article! That's a really interesting perspective. I think I'm so deep into RPG's at this point, that I haven't really thought so much about what I specifically like about small press RPG's versus bigger ones. At this point, I'll get anything that sounds cool. That being said, I definitely have a bias towards games coming out of the small press (obviously, since the podcast I produce is all about small press games!).<br />
<br />
I think for me, it's that the root of our hobby was small press. The creativity, independence and community that engendered RPG's was something that grabbed me as a kid. I remember I wrote a letter to Mike Stackpole of Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes when I was 12 or something about how I was working on a module for it and he wrote me back! I can't find the letter today, which is maddening. But that kind of thing really leaves an impression and I get just as much excitement interviewing Chris Rutkowsky or meeting the Indie Hipsters at Draconis today.            </dd>

                                Thanks. And yes, if you look up the definition of "large press" it's millions in revenue or more than 10 titles a year. By that definition, only half a dozen companies (or less) who publish RPG's fit. In one sense, the whole hobby is small press stuff. But in a more reasonable definition as applied to our hobby, there are clearly some things that are (even smaller?) small press. Note that the original white D&amp;D books were definitely small press. And, as you say, even large press "celebs" in our hobby are usually accessible with a simple email. Note that I stayed away from talking about tastes in reference to "stuff that is cool". Obviously that's probably the biggest factor in any RPG purchase ... finding something attractive in the setting or an innovative mechanic that you like. This is irrespective of small press / large press issues, I think.            </dd>

                                I suppose you do see the "hand of the designer" more readily in small press games. I never really considered that, but it's a good observation.<br />
<br />
I simply prefer games that cater to casual fun - quick to set up, easy to explain, but with enough bits/random elements to feel like a game. Certain small press companies hit that mark for me.            </dd>

                                Yes, that's a good addition. There is no reason for large press games NOT to create games that are quick to set up and easy to explain, but they generally don't. Because of my current life patterns, this is an enormous factor for me as well.            </dd>

                                I'm with Walker on the "sounding cool". I've tried a lot of indy RPGs that just do not scratch my itch at all...and I figured I was done with The Big Companies, until I fell in love with Star Wars Saga.<br />
<br />
Basically, I don't care who puts it out as long as it reads and/or plays in a fun manner.            </dd>

                                I think for me, what draws me to small press games is that their creators have been free to experiment in whatever way they think is necessary. A large press publisher, on the other hand, is somewhat bound to produce a game that contains more tried-and-true elements (mechanics, setting, subject matter, writing style, art choice, authorial voice).<br />
<br />
More experimentation, I figure, leads to more innovation. There are a lot of small press games out there and by no means do they all end up more innovative than large press, but the large number means that there will often be one out of the many small press games that offers something truly unique and new that advances the state of the design art.            </dd>

                                One thing I like about small press games is that many of them focus on conflict other than combat and they are often built for pick-up play and low prep.<br />

I was a freelance writer and designer for what would be considered "large press," and I never had fun. What attracted James and I to going out on our own, and going small press, is what Scott mentions above, the experimentation. We have freedom to design what we want, and that is the best feeling in the world.            </dd>
