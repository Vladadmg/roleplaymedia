Total members
As of 10:52 GMT+1 on October 28th we have 289 members. Wow! The official announcement was just a couple days ago, so this is quite an achievement. And it seems the clichés are all correct: gamers are predominantly male. 253 members are male, 17 female and obviously 19 members chose not to disclose this information. Or the advanced search function is faulty.

Players and GMs
According to our database we currently have 214 members who are players and 228 gamemasters. Wow. That not only means that there are more GMs than players on this network (which is enforcing the alpha gamer theory), it also shows that NOT everyone here plays RPGs (never or just at the moment). It's also possible that people didn't want to disclose this information. But if you ask me this totally defeats the purpose of joining a social network like this one.

Bloggers, Podcasters, Game Designers and more
The biggest group following the players and GMs are bloggers. 185 members (that are 64%) are RPG bloggers. This is not really that surprising since the community assembled here probably around the RPG Bloggers Network and it's members and readers. 164 members are doing writing of some sorts, 130 do some game design. But only 47 members have listed art as one of the types of media they are involved in. 45 members do some cartography.
It's interesting that only 38 people are doing podcasts. That are 13% and much less than I anticipated. Only 19 people are involved with videos.

The network is still brand-new but the structure of our membership is more or less like I anticipated. Our community is mostly made up by male bloggers (or at least gamemasters). What baffles me is the fact that there are a few people who are neither players nor GMs. We should make sure to get them playing in no time! I also would like to bring more players (who are not bloggers or GMs) to the network.

As of 10:52 GMT+1 on October 28th we have 289 members. Wow! The official announcement was just a couple days ago, so this is quite an achievement.

                                Keep in mind also that some of the stats can overlap. For example, I listed myself as both a player and a GM, since I do, in fact, do both. So the thought that there are more GMs than players here may not be 100% accurate, as I suspect most GMs also play on occasion.            </dd>

                                Mark, you are right. I was just pulling data from our members' list by doing advanced searches. I didn't say the statistics are exact, but I thought it might be fun drawing some wild conclusions. ;)            </dd>

                                Questing GM there is already a list in the Podcasters group. That's probably why people didn't respond.            </dd>

                                I wouldn't draw too many conclusions from the statistics. I'm guessing your pulling your data from the initial sign up 'How are you involved in gaming' survey. Based on past experience, people are not very rigorous when they fill those things out.            </dd>

                                There are 38 podcasters and not one of them have listed their shows in the <a rel=nofollow href="http://www.roleplaymedia.net/forum/topics/rpmn-podcasters-list" target="_blank">list</a>?<br />

C'mon. Don't you want to be heard? I know there are a few podcasters in my list of friends.            </dd>

                                There's some truth to that. But I have to admit I am no expert on statistics. Any statistician worth his salt would probably break down in tears after reading my blog post. ;)            </dd>

                                Actually another thing that occurs, from looking at your stats, is that - although you say gamers are predominantly male - it's also evident that most people who have joined the network are GMs. So it might be more accurate to claim that GMs are predominantly male....            </dd>

                                If I had to choose between Facebook and the RPMN I would cancel my Facebook account at once. Alas not everyone thinks this way and a lot of people sign up for just one social network or avoid them completely. From my regular gaming group I expect none to sign up here since the usually don't join social networks and if so only hesitantly.            </dd>

                                What would be interesting would be a poll to ask all members of the network to report how many other players they have in their group who are not plugged into the network. In my case it's 6. Though, casting a wider net, I admin a facebook group for local gamers in my area which has 31 members in addition to myself, and I haven't seen any of them show up here yet. And I know of another local gamer facebook group (I hesitate to call it 'rival') that has 28 members.            </dd>
