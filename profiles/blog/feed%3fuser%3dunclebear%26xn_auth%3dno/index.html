UncleBear is hosting the RPG Blog Carnival for November. The topic is &quot;Community: in-game and in real life&quot;. What does community mean to you, as a player, and what do you want from a community? How does the concept of community factor into your game setting?&lt;br /&gt;

Because I&#039;ve got a lot on my plate at the moment, I&#039;m now keeping online office hours from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Mountain Time, Monday through Friday. That is the only time I will be checking email, RPMN, Twitter, and Facebook. It doesn&#039;t sound like much, but that&#039;s three hours a day, 15 hours per week checking messages, and that&#039;s the limit I&#039;m setting. If you&#039;re trying to reach me, please be assured that I will do my best to get back to you within one business day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Site Redesign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The current goal is to have UncleBear.com transitioned into a gateway for all of the activities below by the end of the year. Rather than having to remember or bookmark a variety of URLs, I want people to have one place where they can go to find out what&#039;s going on with UncleBear (the company) and Berin Kinsman (the person).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UncleBear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
UncleBear is a company dedicated to producing content for and about tabletop roleplaying games. It operates the Role Play Media Network, FandoNM, a small press publishing effort, and offers consulting services to aspiring game designers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Role Play Media Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://RolePlayMedia.net&quot;&gt;http://RolePlayMedia.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The RPMN is a social network for anyone who creates content for and about tabletop roleplaying games, including bloggers, podcasters, writers, designers, and gamemasters, as well as their audiences. It offers free blogs, forums, groups, and chat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;FandoNM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://FandoNM.ning.com&quot;&gt;http://FandoNM.ning.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
FandoNM (Fan Do, &quot;Way of the Fan&quot;) is an organzation greated to promote fan-related activies in the state of New Mexico. It is currently in its infancy and seeking officers and volunteers. While it is currently being operated as a private venture, the goal is to spin it off into a 501(c)3 non-profit organization once it finds its legs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Publishing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 2010 UncleBear will move into small press publishing, offering systemless game mastering, world building, and setting material. This material will be available via DriveThruRPG, RPGNow, Lulu, and other reputable vendors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Game Consulting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
UncleBear offers affordable consulting services to aspiring game designers. These services include proofreading, editing, ghost writing, and confidential private reviews. Previously offered directly by Berin Kinsman, in 2010 UncleBear will be adding additional consulting staff so that each game can be assisted by an experienced consultant who is the right &quot;fit&quot; for the game&#039;s genre and style of play.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Berin Kinsman&lt;/h2&gt;
In addition to operating UncleBear, Berin Kinsman works with other organizations to help promote roleplaying games as a creative and healthy hobby.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Phoenix RPG Examiner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-7705-Phoenix-RPG-Examiner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-7705-Phoenix-RPG-Examiner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While the focus of this Examiner.com column is on the Arizona gaming scene, the material is of general interest and includes game reviews, interviews, and the popular Twitter Follow Friday 5.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;OneBookShelf Featured Reviewer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://DriveThruRPG.com&quot;&gt;http://DriveThruRPG.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://RPGNow.com&quot;&gt;http://RPGNow.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Going into 2010, Berin will be a featured reviewer for the OneBookShelf family of online retail sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Southern Arizona Gamers Association&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
http://SouthernArizonaGamersAssociation&lt;br /&gt;
The Southern Arizona Gamers Association (SAGA) is a non-profit organization whose charter is to promote a culture of family gaming and to foster a closer relationship between the community at large in Southern Arizona and hobby games industry. We promote the social and developmental benefits of gaming. Many of SAGA members are published game authors, hobby games industry insiders, working professionals, distinguished military and accomplished students.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SAGA operates two monthly game days, Ides of Gaming and the Tucson RPG Guild meetup, as well as seminars and convention events, including RinCon. As a SAGA Marshal, Berin helps to promote SAGA and its events.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RinCon 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://RinConGames.com&quot;&gt;http://RinConGames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At the close of RinCon &#039;09, it was announced that Berin will be Communications Director for RinCon 10.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Podcasting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A former regular on the Pulp Gamer Out of Character podcast, Berin is currently preparing to launch a brand new tabletop roleplaying podcast in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
BerinKinsman.com is currently a personal blog covering mostly non-roleplaying game topics. By the end of the year, that domain will redirect to UncleBear.com, and Berin&#039;s &quot;personal space&quot; will completely transition to a hosted space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To keep life manageable, Berin&#039;s Facebook page and Twitter feed are restricted to friends only. You can send a request, but don&#039;t be offended if it&#039;s denied or you don&#039;t get a response. If you don&#039;t know Berin personally, in &quot;real life&quot;, the best way to contact him is via the UncleBear accounts.                    </content>

This isn&#039;t a list of recent blog posts. It&#039;s a social network for RPG bloggers and RPG blog readers, where things can be discussed, tips can be traded, events can be coordinated, and more. Of course, you can blog from here as well if you don&#039;t already have a blog somewhere else. The most popular blogs will be featured on the front page, but all blogs can be seen on the blogger&#039;s page and on the &quot;Blogs&quot; tab at the top.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Quick Tour&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here&#039;s an overview of the site, and some tips on how you can get the most out of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;My Page&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is your personal profile, and it&#039;s customizable to suit your needs. I recommend moving the RSS feed box to top and center on your page (the &quot;My Page&quot; link at the top) and adding the feed to your blog. Then when people go to your page to check you out, they can see your most recent blog posts and click through to your site! The more you participate in other things, such as chat, forums, and groups, the more you&#039;ll be seen and them more people will check out your profile page and your blog.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Blogs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you don&#039;t have a blog elsewhere, you can start one here! Even if you do, you can start another one. Unfortunately, at this time ther is no way to directly link your existing blog, but you can always make a short &quot;roundup&quot; post plugging content recently added to your own site. The most popular blogs will automatically be feature on the from page, but all blogs can be seen on the member&#039;s page and via the &quot;Blogs&quot; tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Forum&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, there&#039;s one great big generic forum for all topics. depending upon need, it can be broken out into categories to accommodate breakout topics. The most recent forum topics will appear on the front page, but all topics can be seen on the &quot;forums&quot; tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Chat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Live conversation with other members. located both at the bottom of the main page and on the &quot;Chat&quot; tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Groups&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can start a group for anything -- specific games and settings (DYD 4e, Savage Worlds etc.), regional interests (Arizona Bloggers, German bloggers, etc), topics (cartography, adventure design), absolutely anything. The 10 most recently active groups will be displayed on the left sidebar on the main page, but all Groups can be accessed from the Groups page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Events&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Holidays, conventions, blog carnivals, and other events can be added to the calendar. A great way to remember things, promote stuff, and keep track of things you can be blogging about. The 10 latest events are displayed on the left column of the main page, and all of them can be seen on the &quot;Events&quot; tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Members&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The most popular members (measured by who gets clicked on and &quot;friended&quot; the most) will appear on the from page, but all members can be viewed on the &quot;Members&quot; tab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The site has the option to add audio and video, so podcasts and vidcasts can be added in the future. That costs, though, so it will depend upon how quickly the network grows and the sort of revenue that can be raised through donations and ad revenue.                    </content>
