                        &lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/l8mBqfWUpnS37adiWV8UQcx7-CUm1AZ55-sPQYVgi8A_/BoLCouvFinie783062.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;/&gt;I had the good fortune to be able to interview Simon Washbourne in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.therpghaven.com/podcast/?p=191&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the latest episode of the RPG Haven podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I&#039;m writing this blog to straight pimp my podcast, but I truly am a big fan of Simon&#039;s work and hope that more people are exposed to it. I credit Barbarians of Lemuria with making me interested in fantasy settings again. Its rules and setting perfectly capture the sword &amp;amp; sorcery fantasy genre.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The setting of Barbarians of Lemuria is a swords &amp;amp; sorcery one, based on Lin Carter&#039;s Thongor novels, which in turn take place in Robert E. Howard&#039;s Hyboria, but millennia before Conan&#039;s time. Magic is scarce and feared. Humans are the only player race. It has a lost world, post-fantasy apocalypse vibe. Personally, I find it works perfectly in Conan&#039;s Hyboria as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Its simple and elegant rules allow players a lot of creative leeway yet it is mechanically solid at its base so it never feels handwavy. The magic system is also really cool. Magical power is much more limited in the world of Barbarians of Lemuria, as it should be, but magic-bearing characters are still fairly effective. Powerful spells are possible but their requirements in time, materials and execution are high and rich enough that they can be the motivation for an adventure or even an entire campaign.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The pdf is available on RPGNow and the print version should be in game stores this summer. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/barbarians-of-lemuria&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;original version of the game&lt;/a&gt; was a free one and it is still available. The commercial version is significantly improved, in content, rules and presentation. But the base mechanics are almost identical and if any of what I have written so far interests you, I strongly recommend that you download the free version and give it a read.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Simon is a true independent, small-press designer and he has designed quite a few games, with some unique and creative premises. He clearly designs games because that&#039;s what he loves to do. Anyone interested in small press games and independent design and publishing should find his interview enlightening.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can listen to it and past episodes with other interesting independent game designers over on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.therpghaven.com/podcast&quot;&gt;The RPG Haven Podcast homepage&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to it in iTunes. I&#039;d love to hear your commentary!&lt;br /&gt;

                        &lt;b&gt;How to get a gaming group&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s very exciting to see all these different gamers from all over the world pop up on this new site. However, it is also draws my sympathy when I see people who don&#039;t have a gaming group. This essay is intended to help those of you who love gaming and don&#039;t have anyone to game with. I have four pieces of general advice, based on my own experiences and observations that I will share with you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s very exciting to see all these different gamers from all over the world pop up on this new site. However, it is also draws my sympathy when I see people who don&#039;t have a gaming group. This essay is intended to help those of you who love gaming and don&#039;t have anyone to game with. I have four pieces of general advice, based on my own experiences and observations that I will share with you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Be patient&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Think about getting a gaming group the way you think about levelling up your character. Just as it takes time and experience to become a Grand Master of Flowers, it takes time and experience to find a kickass group of players whose schedule and tastes fit yours. I believe a lot of players looking for a group take an all or nothing stance, that they must find the perfect group right away. Clearly, it is rare that such a group is suddenly going to present itself to you out of the blue. Instead, think about it as a journey or a quest. Each play session you get a seat at, each group you play with adds to your XP and increases your contacts. So maybe you don&#039;t like the group, but the game they are playing is cool and maybe that game has other players in your town. Or maybe there was one other person in the group that seemed kind of cool and had a similar taste in games to your own that you could contact later. Or maybe the group was absolutely batshit crazy and now you know to totally avoid them (and you&#039;ll have stories to share with other future people in your town who also encountered that group). Don&#039;t expect immediate awesomeness. Rather, consider each participation as a step in a longer journey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I first moved to Montreal, I was really into GURPS. I found some other GURPS players in Montreal and met up with them. The campaign was fun, but after a year, I wanted something different than GURPS. I saw an interesting thread on rpg.net about violence in Unknown Armies. Turned out the author was from Montreal. I contacted him and he offered to run a one-shot for us. I eventually switched over to his group and have been playing with them ever since. But I also worked with my GURPS friends to help set up Draconis, our local con, and we will participate in each other&#039;s con games. This whole process took at least two years and is still evolving. The point is that it is helpful to look at your search for a good group as a process that is ongoing and takes time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Be flexible&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This piece of advice is a corrollary of the Be Patient advice. Maybe everyone in your town is only playing a system you aren&#039;t all that interested in. Or you can&#039;t find your favorite genre among any of the games in town. Or the local con only has games you&#039;ve never heard of. By deciding ahead of time that you won&#039;t participate in certain games or settings, you close yourself off to potential opportunities. Maybe the system isn&#039;t your favorite, but the GM rocks and he is going to run something else in 6 months. I recognize that this can be a tough call. It&#039;s up to you to decide what is your breaking point. I know that after 4+ years of almost exclusively D&amp;amp;D 3.5, I could not play in another session even if Vin Diesel and Wil Wheaton were in the game (okay, well maybe I exaggerate slightly). I would however, strongly recommend that you jettison the requirement that you have to play a game you already know. I have been at min-cons where players sat by themselves after refusing an invitation to play in a game with which they weren&#039;t familiar. If you&#039;re having trouble finding a new group, opening up your range of options is a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Be consistently active&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Local gaming scenes are dynamic. People come and go. Tastes change. Campaigns are born, flourish and die. In order to find the right group for yourself, you need to stay connected to the scene. Putting up an ad in a game store and leaving it there or putting up only a single post on a forum, sitting back and waiting for the invitations to flood in probably won&#039;t cut it. Gamers are easily distracted and wary. You need to put yourself out there regularily so that you get noticed. You also need to be able to express a bit who you are in order to gain trust. The more people know you, the more comfortable they will be inviting you to their game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Montreal, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midnightslair.com/forum/index.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Midnight&#039;s Lair&lt;/a&gt; is the biggest online gaming community. We have a lot of people who love to run one-shots and are happy to welcome new gamers. When someone comes on the Lair and leaves a single post in the &quot;Calling All Gamers&quot; sub-forum with nothing more than &quot;Hey I&#039;m looking for a group&quot;, we try to be welcoming, but we aren&#039;t going to actively search them out the next time we are looking for players if they haven&#039;t been on the Lair for months. On the other hand, newcomers who introduce themselves (we have the tradition of welcoming all new people so they don&#039;t even have to start the thread), hang around, participate in some discussions and reveal a bit about what games they like, what experiences they have had and what kind of playstyle they prefer are for sure going to be invited into a game that the GM thinks they might enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This advice applies online and off. If you are lucky enough to have a decent game store where the employees like and know RPGs (rare, indeed, I know) and there are regular events there, go and hang out. Chat with the people working there. If you don&#039;t want to play in something right away, at least listen in (after a polite &quot;may I?&quot; nod to the GM, of course). Be present on the scene and people will become aware of you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Be a little brave&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As I said above, we are a wary lot. And we aren&#039;t known for our social graces, collectively. A lot of us are shy. Plus, there are real risks to sticking your neck out there. You could be trapped in four hours of railroad, mary-sue hell. But I shouldn&#039;t have to tell you--you who have donned the sword or the phaser and gone out into some other world--that there is no real reward without risk. If we want something good in life, we have to step out a bit from our comfort zone. So go for it. Go talk to that GM at the con whose game sounded right up your alley. Most of us are grateful for any kind of positive attention like that. Go join that forum. Talk to that dude skimming a supplement of a system you are interested in at your local LGS. I know it&#039;s scary! And I know that rejection hurts. But so does the flame of the dragon, but how will you get the treasure if you don&#039;t even go into the cave?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In general, you can see that my advice is asking you to push yourself a little bit. However, I would like to add that we as a community also need to push ourselves as well to make it easier for people who are looking for a group. Some gaming communities are active, welcoming and make it very easy for a newcomer to join in and play. Others are divided, insular and unwelcoming. I&#039;ll talk a little bit next time about strategies for local communities to encourage new players to participate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also recognize that the above advice is very general. In a future post, I&#039;ll talk about some very specific channels and strategies for finding the group for you in your town.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How about you? I&#039;d love to hear how what techniques you have used to get a good group. I&#039;m particularly interested in stories where you either found a good group or where things went really wrong in your search.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Until then, game on, people!                    </content>

I haven&#039;t had a chance to play it yet, but I think as someone who likes quick prep and gameplay but also a bit of structure and mechanics to hang my gameplay on (I&#039;m a big fan of Savage Worlds, for instance), BASH really hit my sweet spot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I got a chance to interview Chris Rutkowsky, the creator of BASH on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.therpghaven.com/podcast/?p=173&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the October 2009 epsiode of The RPG&lt;/a&gt; Haven Podcast. We get into his influences, the gaming scene in his community and especially the mechanics of BASH.&lt;br /&gt;

You can go over to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.therpghaven.com/podcast/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RPG Haven Podcast site&lt;/a&gt; or listen to it here. I hope you find it interesting. I look forward to any general feedback.&lt;br /&gt;
