                        Hopefully it is because I&#039;m willing to spend my allowance for a PS3 just to play the latest installment in the never-ending Enix money-maker. The last FF, Final Fantasy 12, was a horrendous excuse for the PlayStation 2&#039;s withering reputation - it had the best graphics for any RPG at that time and no doubt, critics would agree on me on this one. The only problem was that the story had a little glitch and I was left wondering what Vaan did the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;

A &lt;a href=&quot;http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/105/1057696p1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comprehensive list of anticipated games for this year&lt;/a&gt; has been included in IGN and it seems that next-gen consoles would totally obliterate the PlayStation 2 and other unnamed consoles for that matter - I&#039;m really terrified on how fast things pick up; last thing you know, the PS2 were being flooded by good and bad releases across the nation and look at the poor system - his brother (or sister), the PS 1, can retire and enjoy being watched inside gaming museums.&lt;br /&gt;

Going back to Final Fantasy XIII, I don&#039;t want to spoil the surprise by reading previews but, that doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m going to look at the eye-candy screenshots that the game possesses. I also don&#039;t want to insult the community by bringing in a host of sneak peeks - let&#039;s just wait for March and we&#039;ll judge the game together, okay!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve also been reading online &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.besttermpaper.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;term papers&lt;/a&gt; and glorious reviews about a PSP version of FF 13: Final Fantasy Agito XIII is set to be released this 2010 too and I&#039;m anxiously preparing for the allowance onslaught - two FFs this year? It doesn&#039;t get any better than that. That&#039;s a good way to start of the year.                    </content>
