                        Thanks to all the great feedback on my last blog post about e-publishing. Here&#039;s one that someone brought up: printer-friendliness. This is a really interesting topic. It is facile to just say &quot;be sure your product is printer friendly!&quot; or &quot;include a printer friendly version!&quot; Because really this gets to the core of one of the biggest problems in RPG publishing for the last 15 years: the battle between usability at the table and attractiveness as a product, and to think there will only be one an&amp;hellip;                    </summary>

                        Thanks to all the great feedback on my last blog post about e-publishing. Here&#039;s one that someone brought up: printer-friendliness. This is a really interesting topic. It is facile to just say &quot;be sure your product is printer friendly!&quot; or &quot;include a printer friendly version!&quot; Because really this gets to the core of one of the biggest problems in RPG publishing for the last 15 years: the battle between usability at the table and attractiveness as a product, and to think there will only be one answer to this topic is to think you&#039;ve solved something that nobody else has, and probably nobody ever will.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Me, I am a luddite and a grognard and a mean old man. I am interested primarily in playing the games I buy, not in being &quot;inspired&quot; by fiction or artwork. I am one of those nasty personages who says &quot;shouldn&#039;t the GM decide what the visual style of a game should be instead of some artist thousands of miles away who has never seen the game?&quot; And the strong answer the market has given to me is &quot;no you are wrong shut up shut up shut up shut up.&quot; Mounds of art and fiction in gaming books is the industry standard now, however worthless and waste-of-time-and-money it may be to me personally.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So all right. Given that this is the strong preference of the market and arm-crossing tut-tutters like myself have been marginalized in every way, forever, the end, what are we to make of the demands for &quot;printer friendliness&quot; in electronic publication?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, you can read too much into it. A lot of people just like printing out stuff and having something physical. They are not looking to do what I do which is to write all over them and make them entirely my own. They just want to have something they can read without a gadget. Okay. That&#039;s one group. Another group is like me, we want to have something easy to print out because I want something easy to mark up, fold, spindle, and mutilate. Still others simply resent that you&#039;re selling them something electronic in the first place and can&#039;t understand why you don&#039;t print 50,000 color glossy copies in China and sell them in Borders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your struggle with &quot;printer-friendliness&quot; decisions as an electronic publisher has to start before you even get to questions of who&#039;s buying your product, though. You have to decide what your project is really about. I&#039;m going to say something that might seem very controversial here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You absolutely do not have to produce a printer-friendly version of your electronic product if it would not benefit your product to be printed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fact of it is, if you intend for your product to only be used on a Kindle, laptop, iphone, or whatever, even at the table, then you should make your product the very best it can be in that format. The main issue is that nobody is really doing this yet. How many products are sized and organized to be used on the dimensions of a laptop screen? Virtually none - they are still wedded to the 8 1/2&quot; by 11&quot; PDF format. This is a half-hearted nod to the idea of printing out your product without actually making things any easier to print things out. If you want the person who is using your product to be using a laptop at the gaming table, that&#039;s fine - first of all, you should say so, second of all, you should make your product with laptop screens in mind, and third and most importantly, you should take advantage of the fact that there&#039;s going to be a laptop at the table! Why have a random monster table when you can just sell a random monster generating tool? Why describe a horrific sound when you can sell a horrific sound effect? If that is how you want to go, go all the way!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let&#039;s say that you are not wedded to the idea of the reader of your product using a device whenever they want to use it. You think &quot;hey, it&#039;s at least as good a print product as it is an electronic product&quot;. Cool, there&#039;s nothing wrong with that. Now you come to the question of printer-friendliness and it makes a bit more sense. You know where to look to figure out how to do this. Why would someone print out your product? What parts of your product are they most likely to print out?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Questions of layout begin to take on added importance. If you&#039;re using color, art, typography and borders to make an attractive, usable product, that&#039;s a very different layout toolbox from one that just uses typography and borders, or different kinds of art (line art, for example). You may end up taking on an entirely new layout and editing process to support printer-friendliness. This is not a simple undertaking, but remember, we&#039;ve already decided that this is the best way to support the use of your game at the table.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let me give a few pointers here, using some images from some recent PDF releases.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here&#039;s a small clip from White Wolf&#039;s PDF-only release &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=64285&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Goblin Markets&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/-au-3WPMKzUY2nJRRroWnpv-GqwvAf48BOrU-zBcHBQ_/pdfexamp1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;This is a clip from the first actual page of the PDF, the traditional White Wolf &quot;intro fiction section&quot;. What is the purpose of a piece of introductory fiction? In a print product, you are trying to draw in casual browsers into the emotional world of the product, but in an electronic product, your main goal is to set the stage for what is to come and get the reader interested in your point of view. Let&#039;s talk about what this clip does right first. Typography and layout is important here. White Wolf uses a very recognizable font. As you can see on the right, this font is the same font for all of its (new) World of Darkness products. You only have to read a few lines of a page to realize &quot;this is a World of Darkness product&quot;. The outer border is recognizable because it is repeatedly used for Changeling: The Lost products. If you&#039;re acquainted with Changeling, it&#039;s another method of identifying the product from a quick glance. &quot;I am looking at a Changeling product&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The inner border looks a little weird in the clip, but it only exists around the introductory fiction. That sets it off and makes it easy for someone flipping through the pages to say &quot;Oh, this is the fiction bit&quot;. But look at the background color here! Not only would a printer chug through this color background, but it would have to have exceptional contrast and precision in order to be readable. In other words, these pages are not just printer-unfriendly in terms of the ink it chugs through, but because once it&#039;s printed, you&#039;re going to have to squint to read the dang thing. Worse, if someone really loved this fiction and xeroxed it to give to their players to get them in the mood (illegal, by the way, but let&#039;s just pretend), a Xerox of the fuzzy printout would be even more unusable.&lt;br /&gt;
Compare this to a clip from later in the work:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; src=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/OsSB9q7Mi5ToSXzBRjgnAGmz91GIA0TXgj7oczDs2N8_/pdfexamp2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;Here, you can see that same border from the top has been supplemented with a &quot;thorny&quot; border with no space between the two. The background is now white and there&#039;s good contrast in the source material. The headers are clear. And at the bottom you can see a well set-off sidebar. The only part of this that isn&#039;t &quot;printer-friendly&quot; is the border itself...or is it? What is worth more to the user who wants to print out a supplement to use? Clear identification of the product (outer border: &quot;this is a Changeling product&quot;, inner border: &quot;this is game material&quot;) or printer strain and time? It&#039;s not an easy question. Each consumer will have a different point beyond which they will say &quot;this is too much stuff for my printer to handle&quot; and before which they will say &quot;this material adds value to the product&quot;. So it&#039;s a tough decision for an e-publisher. Some people (luddites like me) see no value in art in gaming products whatsoever, remember. Others enjoy it a great deal. We all fall somewhere along the curve. What&#039;s important about the art decision in this clip is that unlike the background color in the earlier clip, the border art in this clip provides information. It may not be valuable enough information for everyone to say &quot;yes, the expense/trouble of printing that border is justified&quot;, but it at least conveys something.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the way, if you like Changeling (and if you don&#039;t, what&#039;s wrong with you?!), BUY GOBLIN MARKETS. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;Let&#039;s move on to another product I recently got: &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=64688&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Bones of Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was a contest-winning Savage World scenario that was put together and published by Kenzer. Here is a slice from the middle of page 4:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/8JlrABgFnwqomjiABqhO8jIRhn9xs2Ac6*mIGE6EriU_/pdfexamp3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Wow, isn&#039;t that map cool-looking? I mean, completely a bear for printers to chug through, but it&#039;s freakin&#039; cool. It has little icons for the locations of the events in the story, and it really shows San Francisco&#039;s layout well. But remember my questions above: what &lt;b&gt;purpose&lt;/b&gt; does the map serve in the intended use of the product? This one really falls down because, and I quote from the scenario: &quot;If the heroes decide to walk, the distance is about a mile up and down the streets of San Francisco and anyone with the appropriate background can make a Common Knowledge roll to navigate easily enough.&quot; There is no chase scene that could be enhanced by saying &quot;you wheel left past the Standard Oil Building!&quot; or &quot;Up ahead you can see Union Square and crowds of parkgoers!&quot; There is simply no game reason to include this map. The only thing it might offer is a bit of period flavor - it&#039;s a map from that time period, and looks like it, but that flavor is somewhat diluted by the decision to put obviously modern game icons on it. So the decision to include this map was not a printer-friendly decision and if they wanted to do a printer-friendly version, they would cut the map (as you can see, that would be a major layout change to the product). I do want to point out something good about this clip, though. See in the lower left where there&#039;s some &quot;boxed text&quot;? Notice that it is very faintly greyed out. This provides clear visual information (&quot;this is what boxed text looks like&quot;) AND it&#039;s so faint that your printer&#039;s contrast would have to be really screwed up for it to interfere with reading the text. Other good choices are the crisp, clear font for both the text and the header.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the way, if you like Savage Worlds (and if you don&#039;t, what&#039;s wrong with you?!), BUY BONES OF CHINATOWN.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One final clip (I shrank this one down a bit because I&#039;m more focusing on layout issues), this one from Alluria Publishing&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=59428&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Remarkable Races: The Mogogol&lt;/a&gt; for Pathfinder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/j0q56cJ7zgSjeNOfgfR4ERacIj0f9QNQ49azgQobcos_/pdfexamp4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This section illustrates a big challenge for those working with supplements to existing games. The shaded left-to-right racial trait section is highly visually recognizable to those who have worked with or played Pathfinder, D&amp;amp;D3, or D&amp;amp;D4. It quickly conveys information: look here for a stat block. At the same time, it&#039;s likely to be one of the most printed-out or copied sections. If I&#039;m playing a mogogol (and who wouldn&#039;t want to be a frog warrior after playing Chrono Trigger!), I&#039;m going to want to print out that bit and have it attached to my character sheet to remind me what all my abilities are. For some consumers that shaded color section is going to be too annoying, for others it will be just fine and will help them mentally match up the stat block from this supplement with other stat blocks in other games. One last thing I want to point out about this clip. Look at the far left side. See how there&#039;s an index phrase telling you immediately where you are in the product? How amazingly user-friendly is that? And yet how rarely do we see index and usability features like that? Half the time we&#039;re lucky to even get page numbers - here, if I&#039;m flipping through a stack of printed-out Pathfinder supplements looking for mogogol stats, I will know immediately the page I want, it&#039;s written right on the side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the way, if you like Pathfinder (and if you don&#039;t, what&#039;s wrong with you?!), BUY THE REMARKABLE RACES SERIES.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The main things I hope to get across in this blog post are these:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Printer-friendliness&quot; should not be a goal for all electronic products. If you don&#039;t think printing your product is how it should be used, don&#039;t worry about it - you should, however, then worry about how to best adapt your product to the device you wish it to be used with, whether it be a printer or not.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If &quot;printer-friendliness&quot; is a goal, think about what purpose layout and typographical choices have in your product and decide things accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, &quot;printer-friendliness&quot; is not a binary, on-off thing. What one consumer may value in layout and art is not what another one will.                    </content>

                        I was an early adopter of for-pay electronic publishing.

                        I was an early adopter of for-pay electronic publishing. I was used to it - after all, there had been netbooks floating around Usenet&#039;s RPG groups for years before anyone thought to charge for RPGs. Then there was a push to get old TSR products out on PDF, and White Wolf jumped into it, and RPGNow, and the d20 boom, now here we are today and a truly remarkable number of electronic RPG publishers still seem to have no clue what the hell they are doing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So here are some of my pet peeves and happy smiles for electronic RPGs:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Don&#039;t Just Scan Your Print Product&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can&#039;t emphasize enough how disappointing it is to see an electronic version of a game that is just the RPG put through a scanner. Even today there are plenty of games being published where you can&#039;t even cut and paste text! These products clog up your printer if you want to print any of it, they often have fuzzy text where the scanner didn&#039;t scan perfectly, and they are incredibly large in file size.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have a legacy product that you really can&#039;t do anything with BUT scan, see &quot;Price It Right&quot; below. You&#039;re not really offering an electronic RPG, what you&#039;re offering is access to an older product that collectors or other interested people might want to take a look at.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Use Bookmarks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gang, a lot of what I&#039;ll say is &quot;it&#039;s nice if...&quot; but this is not one of them. This is an industry standard. This is the bare minimum. If your product is more than 10 pages long, use bookmarks to aid the reader in quickly getting to the part of the eBook that you want them to get to. Name the bookmarks properly and clearly. (By the way, this is a good way to be sure that the headings you selected for your book are good - would they make sense as a bookmark?)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Do Not Cripple Your Product&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m still seeing products sold which &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be cut-and-paste enabled, but which are not. This is even worse than just scanning a print product, because instead of just being lazy, you&#039;re actively being malicious. I don&#039;t buy any gaming material, either paper or electronic, just for me to read in the safety and comfort of my own mind. I buy it to play with. If your game gets me psyched up, I want to copy off page 4 and pass it around to the players: &quot;Hey gang, here&#039;s some rules for this thing, aren&#039;t they neat?&quot; I want to write in margins and make my own cheat sheets and reference materials. Putting up a big wall around your product gains you absolutely nothing - people stealing your product will still steal it - and it keeps your legit customers from using your product to its fullest potential. Do not ever disable copying-and-pasting or anything like it, not ever, not ever, &lt;b&gt;not ever.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Price It Right&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So maybe your electronic product is not the greatest thing out there. Maybe the bookmarks are unhelpful things like &quot;Chapter 34&quot; or &quot;Chap34&quot; (yes, I have seen this). Maybe it&#039;s too short, or maybe the market is glutted with Third Edition feat PDFs. The great thing about electronic publishing (and the scary thing too) is that many customers will drop $1-$4 on a product that doesn&#039;t have the same amount of polish or content. I will always remember with great happiness the half-d20, half-homebrew sky pirates setting I bought off RPGNow during the d20 boom. It was clearly someone&#039;s campaign notes, haphazardly typed up in Microsoft Word, exported to a PDF automatically, with art scanned from someone&#039;s Trapper Keeper and incomprehensible organization and completely unexpected around every corner. I bought it because it was two bucks and I got every penny&#039;s worth! I was a satisfied customer for that product not because it was a brilliant product that led to endless supplements - but because for $2, a hefty brainstorming tool, even a very haphazard one, is a good purchase. (This has some broader implications for electronic RPG publishers as a whole, but it&#039;s beyond the scope of today&#039;s rant.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So (for example), if you have a legacy product you want to get out to the long-time fans of the game, but you don&#039;t have the capability (financial, temporal or technical) to actually make it a fully featured electronic publication, just price it cheaply and call it an &quot;archival version&quot; or something. Don&#039;t let those inflated eBay prices fool you! Your game is not worth that much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Use Electronicness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So many electronic publishers don&#039;t take any advantage of the format that they work in. Does it support hyperlinks? Can I click on a jargon term and automatically be taken to a glossary to remind me of what it means? Are there layers which show statistics from different systems (or different sorts of narratives, or other presentations) depending on which one I want? Did you package a separate character sheet file at the end so I can easily forward it to an interested friend? How about an electronic catalog of your products with a $1-off coupon for the Next Thing you want me to try? You have so many advantages as an electronic publisher that a print publisher just flat doesn&#039;t. You can do so many things they can&#039;t in terms of presentation. Do you have a website? Can I click on your company&#039;s name in the credits and be taken there? Why not?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The news from White Wolf that they may be leaning more on electronic publishing is probably indicative of how things are going to go in the hobby for a while. They have done an overall quite competent job with their electronic publishing, both with the long-overdue Ready Made Characters series, and the recent Changeling and Exalted products. It&#039;s time to see who the new innovators are going to be!                    </content>

                        A follow on to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roleplaymedia.net/profiles/blogs/goblin-market-sparrowjenny-vs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;last blog post&lt;/a&gt;, about the conflict between two hobgoblins in a goblin market being resolved by the PCs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The basics, for review: Scabramouche must give the first bite of any apple to Sparrowjenny. Sparrowjenny and her brood can&#039;t eat anything else other than that first bite. Scabramouche, annoyed to the point of torment by this arrangement, gives up apples, at least until Sparrowjenny&#039;s &quot;children&quot; starve. The two of them escalate their feud until the master of the market summons the PCs to restore order.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing that happened is that the PCs decided they had to find out more about the players. So one of them (Summer Court ogre, played by RPMN&#039;s own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roleplaymedia.net/profile/JonathanPerrine&quot;&gt;Jon Perrine&lt;/a&gt;), used a power to get Scabramouche&#039;s hate towards Sparrowjenny projected onto him, claiming that he was the one that suggested the punishment Scabramouche was enduring to the True Fae. Obligingly, Scabs began to hate him rather than Jenny or the situation, permitting another character, (Spring Court mannikin) to engage Scabs in negotiation. Appeals to Scabs&#039; better nature had failed (he didn&#039;t have any), but that was suggestive in and of itself. He was actually enjoying watching Sparrowjenny&#039;s brood starve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Well,&quot; offered the mannikin. &quot;Is there something else more cruel that you&#039;d rather do than this?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scabs thought about it and suggested: &quot;You could steal a real human baby and bring it here and I could watch &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; starve instead.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The PCs decided that was not a good idea. But at least there were some negotiations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Winter Court elemental decided she would take some action to figure out the exact parameters of the situation. She snuck an apple in a box lunch and tricked Scabs into accepting it as a gift. Sure enough, he grouchily had to go across and give the first bite to Jenny, and she almost bawled she was so happy, and that made Scabs a hundred times more angry and set in his idea to starve her. But it also gave the PCs more information. Her happiness was one part of what was driving him crazy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;What if it would be more cruel to give her the apple?&quot; someone said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was the plan. The PCs would teach Jenny to pretend to be miserable when Scabs brought her a bite of the apple, and would tell Scabs that they had cursed Jenny so that the apple would taste terrible. (Interestingly, nobody thought about actually cursing her, though an abortive idea was to go to Arcadia to get Jenny&#039;s stomach back from wherever it was. Quickly nixed by the other players before I could do more than lift my eyebrows.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So they coached her and coached her, and scammed Scabs into thinking they&#039;d cursed her, and urged him to give it a test. He brought her an apple, she took that first bite and (roll roll behind the screen...exceptional success!) flew into a choking, mewling, moaning, gagging fit while Scabramouche rolled with laughter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Problem solved. Scabramouche would eagerly eat plenty of apples just to watch her spasm with pain. Sparrowjenny got the food she and her brood needed not to starve. The goblin market would no longer be polarized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you might imagine from this little episode, one of the recurring themes of this game is &quot;what we do when we can&#039;t get what we want&quot;. There really was no solution so long as the characters continued to want what they wanted. The only thing the PCs could do was to back the truck up and go around, find some other thing (cruelty, in Scabramouche&#039;s case) that one character wanted more than what they were doing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In White Wolf games, you&#039;re encouraged to come up with a &quot;theme&quot; for your game, and a lot of GMs skip it, or they give one or two words. I don&#039;t agree with that. I think your themes should be very, very specific in terms of what they&#039;re about, but able to be applied to many situations. Every NPC that I&#039;ve got in my NPC notebook has something they want that they can&#039;t get. What they do about that is the plot of the game.                    </content>

                        So last night I launched a Changeling game. The characters are members of a motley - the Intercessors - who intervene in disputes and resolve them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The game started in a Goblin Market. Goblin Markets in Southern Arizona/Northern Mexico are along two lines: a swap meet, or a drug deal. They all appear to be trailer parks too. This particular market was called &quot;Doctor Whitetree&#039;s Swap Meet&quot;. Doctor Whitetree had a problem and summoned the characters to deal with it. Two of his vendors, Sparrowjenny and Scabramouche, were feuding and they had polarized the swap meet into factions, which was driving away customers. The preliminary payment was a box lunch (sandwich, fruit, chips or potato salad, and a grape soda whose bottle had a label not in any language they recognized) and one silver coin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The characters went to discuss the case with Sparrowjenny first. Sparrowjenny had some birdlike features but chief among them was a big giant beak. She started into her sales pitch about the shiny objects that she had, but stopped suddenly, sniffing the air and, almost crying, asked if the characters had an apple. When the apple came out she almost broke down into sobs. Finally they got the story out of her:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She lived in the orchard and larder of a True Fae who had torn out her stomach, so that she couldn&#039;t eat anything, and no matter how much food she was surrounded by, she would still starve constantly. This amused the True Fae greatly, who would often chain her to tables at feasts and would always be sure she cried herself to sleep in an orchard whose trees hung heavy with delicious fruit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One day the greedygut nasty troll Scabramouche was caught in the orchard shovelling dozens and dozens of apples down his maw. His uncaring, brutish smirk at her starvation also tickled the True Fae, but the theft could not be overlooked, so the True Fae told them this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Scabramouche, every apple that you ever have, you must give the first bite to Sparrowjenny.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sparrowjenny was elated with the arrangement, it meant she could actually not be starving all the time. In fact, she grew so strong that eventually she escaped or wandered away, ending up at the market. (Scabramouche was allowed to go after being punished, but in practice his greed for apples would ensure that he could never be far away from Sparrowjenny for very long.) She even &quot;hatched a brood&quot;, stomachless naturally, and chews up, digests and vomits that first bite of apple for them sometime.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But now, Scabramouche has decided he can give up on apples just long enough to watch her brood starve to death while she wails her sorrow. Can the characters get Scabramouche to accept their apple? She&#039;d be ever so grateful and give them this lovely headlamp reflector that one of the PCs was looking at.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scabramouche (a horrible, fat-gutted, massive-handed, green, sloppy-drooling monster) told them a similar story, but to hear him tell it, he despises Sparrowjenny for her patheticness and reliance on him, and anticipates the delicious cruelty of her children starving to death enough that he can give up on apples and just get by on stolen applesauce. He sells horrible smells and methamphetamine and would the characters like any?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The two vendors have paid and inveigled the other merchants into taking their sides, with the result that everyone is arguing, scheming and attacking each other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may recognize this if you ever took a course in contracts as a question of reliance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sparrowjenny relies on Scabramouche for that first bite of apple. But the True Fae neglected (?) to force Scabramouche to continue to obtain apples forever. So when Scabramouche makes a decision that normally would be completely unremarkable - to stop eating apples - it damages Sparrowjenny, who has come to rely on that first bite.&lt;br /&gt;
