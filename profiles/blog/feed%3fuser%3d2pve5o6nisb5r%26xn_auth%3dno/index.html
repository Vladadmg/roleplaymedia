&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TNNjMI5TjDI/AAAAAAAAAKE/H2vndUyzoJE/s1600/shanghai.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TNNjMI5TjDI/AAAAAAAAAKE/H2vndUyzoJE/s1600/shanghai.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
There have been folks who have felt, and not without justification, that while Savage Worlds is awesome...it falls short of &quot;epic&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Savage Mojo has felt that way themselves, releasing their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=69046&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Suzerain&lt;/a&gt; multiverse setting for Savage Worlds, which goes so far as to add a whole new tier to character advancement beyond Legendary: Demigod.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am ashamed to say that I only have the free version of Suzerain at the moment, which is pretty comprehensive, providing most of the necessary rules needed to get your PCs at Demigod rank, and half a dozen sample PCs, scaled to various ranks...which is what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=83960&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Shangai Vampocalypse&lt;/a&gt; is built for. Let me reiterate: Shangai Vampocalypse is a Savage Suzerain plot point campaign *designed* for beings well beyond Legendary, and you can use the free version of Suzerain if you don&#039;t mind using pregens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
FOR PLAYERS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shangahi Vampocalypse is set in China in the year 2048, after a nanotech virus was used to turn soldiers in vampires, for two reasons: 1) They&#039;re scary and 2) They can feed off of their rival soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This, shockingly, has not gone well...and now the PCs have to rush against time in order to save the world from a rampaging vampire army. No pressure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can either build to this as a grand culmination of a lengthy Suzerain campaign, or you can just level guys up to Demigod and drop them in, your choice. Luckily, popping Savage Worlds guys up from Novice to Demigod is pretty simple, just taking advances as you go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In typical Savage Worlds fashion, we get a list of character archetypes appropriate to the setting, in this case falling more under party function (like Advisor and Long Range Fighter) rather than character concept.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NEW EDGES, HINDRANCES AND POWERS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The setting is Mysticism Meets Cyberpunk, and there are a number of suitable Edges and Hindrances to accomodate this. Ancient Master, for instance, requires your character being Elderly, but also makes his your unarmed damage equal to your Smarts + Spirit. Shang-Fu Edges are martial arts Edges, for those hand to hand types.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rather than Arcane Backgrounds, Suzerain uses Pulse Paths, and Shanghai Vampocalypse provides Bioartificial Eugenics and Master of Veneration, the first being very much a cybernetics type thing and the latter allowing your PCs to do crazy mystical things involving spirits.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also get a listing of setting tech, such as medpacks that get &quot;slapped&quot; onto the body and breakdown over time, the common &quot;chip in the head&quot; type feature and all kinds of crazy weapons and armor, including nanite-enhanced weapons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
FOR GMs&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here, the GM gets to find out what is REALLY going on, as there is far more at stake than just science ran amok. Indeed, events are being manipulated by a nefarious foe, and this particular reality nexus is so crucial that, if the villain is not stopped, all of reality could suffer for it, and not just this world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The PCs are on a STRICT time from (12 hours), and this section does a GREAT job of laying out ideas on how to put the pressure on them, forcing them into hard decisions about collateral damage and the choice between saving people and losing time in the process.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The city of Shanghai gets a solid, but not heavily detailed overview, followed by tons of generic stat blocks for NPCs and Mooks encountered in the city, like Grunts and Hackers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Gods of Shangai are also discussed here, giving an overview of their M.O.s, as well as the locations and descriptions of their temples. Note that the Gods are Gods...meaning that even though they depend on the PCs for survival, they can&#039;t help but screw with them sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also get Edges and Hindrances specific to vampires. Note that only about 1% of all vampires are intelligent...the rest being mindless, savage monsters. We also find out precisely what happens to people who are infected (including a way out for PC Demigods, if they so desire).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then, the Main Event: The countdown to the apocalypse...the 12 point Plot Point campaign (labeled T-12, T-11, etc, in a nice touch). Each plot point is helpfully summarized first, before detailed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I won&#039;t go into heavy spoilers here, but T-12 starts off as a transition from your presumed old campaign into the new one, recruited by the Celestial Court to save, well, everything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
T-11 introduces the PCs to the vampires, the city, and the only guy that can stop the vampire plague: The same guy that started it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Around T-10, the villain of the piece begins to slowly reveal himself...but only slowly right now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
T-9 provides an escort mission as well as a hint at how dangerous the vampires really are, with Master Vampires leading the mindless ones.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By T-6, the stakes are rising, as nuclear weapons have gotten involved, and if the PCs fail here, then they find out that their 12 hour timetable was off by six hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
T-2 provides an encounter with childlike dopplegangers of the PCs, as well as another &quot;instant lose&quot; breakpoint.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, T-1 culminates in an epic, Godlike battle back where the campaign began, and can end in one or more PCs ascending to Godhood if they are victorious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book helpfully provides hints and tips on returning to 2048 at a later date if you so desire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the 12 plot points, 18 Savage Tales are included, with each set of six being grouped together for a specific reason.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first six involve entreating the six Gods of Shanghai for assistance, and the Gods helpfully stop time while the PCs are pursuing those goals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second set involve time travel, as the PCs travel throughout Shanghai&#039;s past to find the Chimes of Discord, again halting time on these quests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final six are all set in the 12 hour timeline and flesh out certain areas: One Savage Tale provides valuable insight into the nature of their enemy, but also them up for a brutal trap. The next tale is meant to be used if a PC becomes infected and doesn&#039;t want to become a vampire. Two others are used to gain valuable equipment for the campaign. A fifth is useful for when the PCs need access to healing and the sixth is a bizarre diversion into a virtual reality video game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last several pages provide stats on specific NPCs present in the campaign, as well as the generic vampire stat blocks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again...if you&#039;re thinking Savage Worlds isn&#039;t epic enough (and I do, sometimes) then Suzerain may be right up your alley, if Shanghai Vampocalypse is any indication.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Obviously, if you have the full Suzerain book, you&#039;ll get more use from the book. That said, you can still probably run this with the Test Drive rules and the free Suzerain &quot;Play Now!&quot; book...just might have to fudge a couple of things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love that the stakes are *very* high...not just the &quot;World could end if we don&#039;t beat the Big Boss&quot; kinda thing...but that there are about three or four breakpoints from about the midpoint of the campaign on where reality can spin off the rails.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For pure cyberpunk goodness, I would still recommend Interface Zero...but this is a great campaign that resoundingly kicks the &quot;There&#039;s no life after Legendary&quot; canard out the door.</content>

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TNKElqXGVrI/AAAAAAAAAKA/-Vwcj1dGZZs/s1600/progenitor.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TNKElqXGVrI/AAAAAAAAAKA/-Vwcj1dGZZs/s1600/progenitor.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Arc Dream has some of the best ideas for books.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The only problem is, I have never been able to get comfortable with the ORE system. I own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=56509&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Dreadful Secrets of Candlewick Manor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82651&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Monsters and Other Childish Things&lt;/a&gt;, and we&#039;ve made characters...it just never makes it to game time, mostly because I am just so skeptical about how well the system would work out for us in play.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82652&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Progenitor&lt;/a&gt; is a setting book for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=78394&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Wild Talents 2e&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very much an alternate reality type setting. Amanda Sykes, an unassuming housewife type in 1968, gets nearly Godlike power...(no pun intended)...with a catch: When she uses her power on someone, they become empowered. This goes on...it&#039;s now modern times and there are people with powers running around all over the planet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Progenitor is a $20 PDF that is copy and paste enabled, fully searchable and bookmarked. Even has a clickable table of contents. Considering it clocks in at nearly 400 pages, features like that are ESSENTIAL. It is black and white, aside from the cover, and it does require the Wild Talents rules (the full second edition will work, as should the Essentials in a pinch).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOT TALKING ABOUT THE WAR&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Honestly, I usually skip the setting fluff pieces. Occasionally, I&#039;ll skim the first few paragraphs...but a lot of times, I just move on. I intended to do the same here, as Amanda Sykes is interviewed by a reporter, but I found myself intrigued. Sykes comes across as a very relatable Godlike being.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THIS CHANGING WORLD&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here, we get the World in the Four Color system as written by Ken Hite in the Wild Talents rulebook. For those curious, it starts at Red 5 and drops to Red 2 quickly. The Gold Axis is also a 2, while Blue goes from 1 to 3 pretty quickly. The Black Axis hangs around 2-3.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is also where the author talks about how the PCs can change the world, and details how the power tiers work, as each &quot;generation&quot; produces fewer (and weaker) supers. There is also a character option for &quot;Marks&quot;, who are beings marked by the campaign&#039;s &quot;Dark Energy&quot;, but have no real powers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Five sets of power templates also exist, for quick PC or NPC creation if nothing else. But basically, the way it works is that this Dark Energy spreads, creating more supers when the powers are used, generally giving them what they desire at that point (ala Aberrant).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the here and now, the first two tiers are all filled up, leaving tiers three through ten open for population. One interesting optional rule allows for &quot;backwash&quot;: When a metahuman dies, there&#039;s a chance that their power returns to its ancestor, causing them to spawn again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The world also moves on four Metrics: Suspicion, Technology, Economy and Warfare, each of which help to set the tone for what is going on in the world at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, here is the cool part: Random event charts, depending on the &quot;tone&quot; of the world. I loves me some random. Every game year, you take the two highest gauges, roll the dice, check the length and width with the relevant chart, and get the events. Any isolated dice become personal events (which have their own charts as well).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Authoritarianism can produce results such as cameras being installed in every public place and street corner, beings with Dark Energy being refused the right to vote, citizens begin refusing jury duty and more. Some personal events include stolen DNA being used to clone PCs, and a serial killer stalking metahumans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imperialism can give us fishermen turned pirates, dictators defaulting on their debts and a radical Atheist group declaring a...er...Holy war.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#039;s 12 charts (counting the personal charts for each) of random events...enough to make my mouth water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The chapter ends with a broad overview of the important NPCs, as well as the timeline, before the book dives into each with an immense amount of detail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THESE CHANGING TIMES&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the extensive timeline from 1968 through Y2K. There are two timelines presented, with one being &quot;our&quot; history and the other being the Progenitor history, when Amanda Sykes gained her powers and began (inadvertantly) infecting people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We get campaign frameworks along the way, spinning out of historical events in the Progenitor timeline, such as terminally ill patients rescued by young Tina Shaw and now not only alive, but empowered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Historical figures such as Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover and Martin Luther King, Jr. all wind up empowered and influencing events, even after King&#039;s death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The world mostly carries on next to ours with minor changes until 1983...when the Metalocalypse occurs, complete with killer robots hunting metahumans and the biggest threat of nuclear war yet. Martial law gets declared in the US and much deatha and chaos ensues...but in a nice change, the world almost seems to get better for it, at least for a time afterwards...at least until President Reagan&#039;s untimely death, and the ascension of George HW Bush.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Things begin building to a new head in the late 90s, all culminating in the year 2000, which is left wide open for your group to explore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love the timeline and the setting BEGS to be run in a year-to-year campaign, skipping over months here and there so that the PCs can see (and probably change) the world around them. Given how heavily political the timelines are, I was honestly expecting to be annoyed or offended by the author&#039;s take on history, but was instead pleased: Some historical figures are painted in a very bad light, others are not. The world isn&#039;t necessarily nice to them, but there good and bad guys on all sides of the political spectrum, much as it truly is.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THE METAHUMANS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here, we get tons of NPCs, starting with Tier One (Amanda Sykes) and running down through Tier Ten...with fictional characters and historical figures along the way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every character is given their background, Loyalties, Passions, Power Suites and Destiny...everything you need to know, from where they begin, to where they are going to end up (unless the PCs get involved).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the dozens and dozens of important characters, we also get a listing of straightforward &quot;bad guys&quot;...no deep, morally ambiguous motivations...just people who need to get beat up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, as each character appears in the timeline, they are crossreferenced with the page number here, for extra utility. That&#039;s a big plus, in my view.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DEVICES AND DEVELOPMENTS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here we get into just how the world has been changed, technologically speaking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We start with syntergenes, which amount to tangible ideas and how to construct them (taking into account important things like symbolism, social class and even the language barrier)...you can even determine how quickly the effects kick in and how deep the brainwashing goes, complete with examples from the setting&#039;s history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We next get various devices by superinventors, complete with the &quot;when&quot;, such as Soviet laser guns in &#039;78 and modular cars in &#039;85.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Other Progenitor-specific developments such as the rise of Atlantis in &#039;68, The Church of the Emerald virgin convinced that Amanda Sykes is the reincarnation of the Virgin Mary and the Metavictims Advocacy and Support Group, founded when Jarvis West gained powers in &#039;69 and immediately went on a rampage, trying to hurt everyone he could.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A character sheet and index would have been nice, the index especially so for those getting the physical book instead of the PDF.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s a very compelling setting, reminiscent of Aberrant and very much an &quot;actions matter&quot; kind of thing. Again, it BEGS to be ran from at least the dawn of Tier Three and playing loose with the passage of time, so that the long term effects on the world can be played out. In fact, I intentionally skipped over discussing much of the character or timeline sessions in detail, just so I didn&#039;t inadvertently spoil some of the twists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That said, at 380 pages, it feels like a lot of it could probably have been said in less. I think a good product could have become great with tighter focus in the writing...something. It just never quite feels like the nearly 400 page count is fully needed, with the bulk of the book consumed with NPC write-ups and the two timelines...trying to cram so much stuff in, and only really slowing down at a couple of points, hurting the presentation.</content>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timeoutdiversions.com/ostore/&quot;&gt;Killer Thriller&lt;/a&gt; is the first RPG from Timeout Diversions, the new small publishing venture by Tony Lee, who I am most familiar with through his work on the WWE Know Your Role RPG...he&#039;s setting this imprint up as the &quot;Cheapass Games&quot; of RPG, barebones PDF products with more substance than style, at a low price.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Killer Thriller It&#039;s a b-movie horror RPG, designed to be very tongue in cheek, a slightly less serious &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82728&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Slasher Flick&lt;/a&gt;, if you will and unlike a traditional RPG, every player is meant to play three (or more) PCs, and any character of any consequence who isn&#039;t The Monster is meant to be played by the PCs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
VICTIMS OF CIRCUMSTANCE&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As noted, everyone plays multiple PCs, ensuring that no one gets kill &quot;off screen&quot;. Character creation is simple enough, as PCs have three Inabilities (Unwise, Unluck and Undone) and you have a 7, 8 and 9 that you assign to each stat. When you roll against an Inability (2d6), if you roll under, something not great happens...if you roll it exactly, something epically bad happens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unwise is a measure of how not smart a PC is, and thus how likely they are to make...questionable...decisions...like when the lights go out and you hear a noise in the basement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unluck is a little better than Unwise, as it&#039;s just like likelihood that something will go wrong, not that you screw yourself up. Note: It&#039;s still bad. Unluck is used when you&#039;re trying to climb through the half broken window on the second floor, for instance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Undone is both the social stat, and what you use to keep your crap together...i.e., seeing if your PC completely loses it when he boyfriend is found nailed to the bedroom door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is also Unharm, which is Hit Points, essentially.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, you define all of your PCs with a stereotype (although I might recommend starting with the stereotype and then going to the stats, but that&#039;s me). Every Stereotype gets a &quot;free pass&quot;, which is something related to their schtick that they don&#039;t have to roll for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, characters get Unreal (think Advantages) and Unthinkable (Disadvantages), of which there are only about four each, so we&#039;re not talking a complicated system here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For a pretty dirt simple system, the author does a GREAT job of suppyling all kinds of examples, both in-game and from films, about how the Inabilities work. The three stats might be a tad simplified, but it&#039;s a beer-and-pretzels horror movie game...let it go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THe way the group of PCs thing works is that when a character kicks it, you get to add their Unharm to another one of your characters. If you describe the death scene well, you can get more Unharm. This leads to one of your PCs eventually being big enough and bad enough to stand up to the bad guy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When it&#039;s down to the Monsters vs Last Surivors, the Monsters have Inabilities that finally kick in, essentially putting the Monsters and Last Survivors on even footing. Last Survivors ALSO get to reroll doubles, making them even more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, we get a list of common weapons, and their damage and any special notes that might apply (like getting tangled in barbed wire, or taking damage from electricity until something kicks you loose).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, the chapter abounds with examples, including a chainsaw weilding maniac performing an Epic Fail while trying to slice up a victim.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DEAD THINGS WALKING&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is all about Monsters, and the types of set-ups you can use...like a Boss Monster and Minions, like if you wanted to do Dracula and his Brides. This would also work with The Lost Boys, although I think that one would qualify for two bosses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Among other things, it helpfully reminds you to give your monster a Weakness...with the helpful advice that you can ignore that Weakness come the sequel (see any Nightmare on Elm Street).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rules for making a monster are real similar to the rules for making a Victim, and take up about a Paragraph...and a lengthy list of alliterative entries as inspiration for your Monsters, ranging from insane animals to demons to zombies and even using unearthly natural disasters are your baddy, each with a relevant movie quote for flavor (the PDF is filled with relevant movie quotes).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
RUNNING THE SHOW&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is, essentially, a pair of horror &quot;films&quot; for your game, complete with relevant Monsters. The first is a slasher flick set in a mining camp, complete with three different &quot;twists&quot; to choose from. The second is a combo alien invasion/wheel out the monsters montage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even if you don&#039;t use the &quot;films&quot; as written, there are some very nice examples of monsters to use to build your own, including (essentially) The Blob, Dracula and Jason Vorhees.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book ends with the author detailing the 15 year evolution of the game, and his apprehension about releasing it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seriously, it&#039;s a good fun game that can be a blast with the right group. It makes Slasher Flick (with 100 premade archetypes) look like GURPS in comparison, it&#039;s that light...but it is very detailed. There shouldn&#039;t be much confusion about how to do anything in the game, and the writing is very witty to boot...(seriously, I&#039;ve never seen so many footnotes in a 25 page PDF)...so if you&#039;re wanting a dry, textbook read...this isn&#039;t it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s definitely NOT for someone wanting a gritty horror experience...it is meant to emulate the schlockiest excesses of the horror film genre, not that that&#039;s a bad thing.</content>

&lt;br /&gt;
No, I haven&#039;t suddenly started playing Labyrinth Lord since I reviewed &lt;a href=&quot;http://mostunreadblogever.blogspot.com/2010/10/tommys-take-on-blood-moon-rising.html&quot;&gt;Blood Moon Rising&lt;/a&gt;. Like that review, I will be examining this adventure for utility with other RPGs, namely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=51078&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82385&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;High Valor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Inn of Lost Heroes is a 38 pag PDF, bookmarked, and largely black and white. As it goes with adventures, please be prepared for spoilers, though I&#039;ll try to go light.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
***BEGIN SPOILERS***&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SERIOUSLY, GO AWAY IF YOU DON&#039;T WANNA BE SPOILED&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
***LAST WARNING***&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those running a more traditional game, the adventure expects that you have a standard party spread with a fighter/dwarf, rogue/halfling, wizard/elf and cleric. The Inn of Heroes was a popular stopping off point for adventurers...and now it&#039;s cursed hellhole with a creepy, Silent Hill vibe after a silly fight between adventurers spilled out of control, killing most of the family that owned it and causing it to burn down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now it materializes on the anniversary of its destruction, hoping to entice adventurers to their doom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Inn has three &quot;versions&quot;: The Living World Inn, the Ash World Inn and the Burning World Inn. Once it shifts into those other two, freakiness truly ensues and the adventurers cannot leave until they find a blessed medallion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THE INN OF (LOST) HEROES&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the description of the Inn as it appears in the Living World and Ash World. For instance, there is a sign above the mantle that says &quot;The Inn of Heroes&quot;...until the shift to the Ash World...where it becomes &quot;The Inn of Lost Heroes&quot;, as &quot;Lost&quot; is burned into it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is some nice interplay between the worlds as the family dog Old Beast can be befriended in the Living World, and when he appears in the Ash World, he at least has the courtesy of killing anyone who befriended him last.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout the Inn, in the Ash World, are passageways into the Chambers where the PCs get to gather the Medallion, each of which is helpfully heralded to the PCs by the talking corpses of adventurers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also get two maps of the Inn, one keyed for the GM and one for the PCs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
LIVING WORLD ENCOUNTERS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We get the classic adventuring set-up, complete with a mysterious, hooded stranger carrying an ominous warning for the PCs. There are several opportunities to recruit new NPCs to the party (especially if the PCs are lacking an area in the Fighter/Mage/Cleric/Thief dynamic)...there is also an unruly adventuring party, and this whole scenario is meant to repeat history from the night the Inn first burned down. The PCs can actually escape into the night (in which case you probably need something else to do for the evening) or they get trapped inside the burning inn...and things go crazy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ASH WORLD ENCOUNTERS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming they remain trapped, now the place is grey and ashy, ala Silent Hill. The other adventurers are here as well, and the PCs will certainly encounter them. The bulk of the adventure takes place in the Ash World as the PCs get clued in on the Medallion, which is hidden in four chambers, each requiring a Fighter or Thief or Mage or Cleric...but here is why there are so many NPCs, granting extra options to the players to recruit folks for the tasks, to fill in their gaps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone gets to fight The Burning Hag, a vicious recurring foe who focuses on NPCs in the first fight, taking out a few key NPCs just to rattle the rest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each of the four Chambers holding the shards is described...each with a challenged geared towards a character class, and each having a NASTY curse for the heroes when they succeed. In addition to the normal encounters, there are a series of random encounters specifically for the Ash World to help fill in this part, many of which can be used to bring the surviving NPCs back on board.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once the heroes recover all four pieces of the Medallion, it sets up another go with the Burning Hag. Assuming the PCs succeed, they have a choice: Walk away or try to put this place to rest once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
BURNING WORLD ENCOUNTERS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming they stick around, they get to remain in the end as it burns fiercely...and they get to fight each other to the death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Honestly, it&#039;s a pretty cool twist, essentially making the PCs their own boss fight, and not in the cheap &quot;mirror foe&quot; way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Last Man Standing has the opportunity to end it all and save everyone. In fact, that&#039;s the kicker: If the PCs go through with ALL of this, they can save everyone. If they cut and run, anyone that was lost is utterly doomed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
APPENDIX&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Appendix provides two magic items, one being the Medallion and the other beings crests that can protect adventurers from the worst of the effects in the adventurer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, we get the Burning Hag, insane heroes trapped in the Ash World, heroes who have been burnt to death and are now a threat and creepy fungi.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THOUGHTS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s a great, creepy adventure. I don&#039;t like it as much as I do Blood Moon Rising, if for no other reason than it&#039;s incredibly easy for the adventure to fall apart by the PCs just deciding to get out when the warning comes down in the taproom fight before the shift to the Ash World, rendering the whole thing moot, and Blood Moon Rising just had more overall utility, with the potential homebase for adventurers, long term adventure potential, etc...but The Inn of Lost Heroes still has a cool, creepy vibe ala &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=701&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Ravenloft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think Savage Worlds could do it admirably well...most of the frameworks for the classes are present in the game AND it is probably the best system I&#039;ve seen for when you need to have NPCs in the party.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still a very good adventure, and Pete Spahn is absolutely dead set on not railroading PCs, no matter what, which is pretty refreshing in published adventures.</content>

It&#039;s going to be hard not to compare &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=84288&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Iron Dynasty: Way of the Ronin&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82054&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Wu Xing: The Ninja Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, given how strong of an impression that game made on me, and how recently it was that I reviewed it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One big difference is that Iron Dynasty is kind of inspired by anime...whereas Wu Xing is heavily inspired by anime...that alone should tweak the feel considerably. I&#039;m also terribly familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=51078&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt;...it being my favorite in print RPG system...so that, plus Reality Blurs&#039; reputation (I&#039;ve never read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=55813&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;RunePunk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=77953&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Realms of Cthulhu&lt;/a&gt;, believe it or not) gives me high hopes going in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So...does Iron Dynasty live up to &quot;heavy metal oriental action&quot;? Savage Worlds is probably a great system to accomodate it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WORDS FROM A WISEMAN&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is the setting &quot;fluff&quot;, laying the groundwork for the world. Industrialization is crushing the spirit and honor that true warriors lived by, and in the face of imperialistic expansion all who would truly live free are being called to take up the sword and embrace the Way of the Ronin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Okay, that does sound awesome. Kinda appeals to the libertarian in me, not to get too political.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Iron Dynasty begins with the assassination of the Emperor and the installation of one of his two twin sons as the new Emperor. When the missing twin returns home, he&#039;s exiled (instead of killed, as the Emperor was told to do by his handlers)...and winds up returning - now the Witch-King - with an army of machines, crushing his brother&#039;s empire and taking his place, ruling with the might of machines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Years later, history repeats itself somewhat as the new Witch-King, cousin of the new Empress, arrives...seeking to take the throne. He&#039;s dismissed out of hand, and leaves a nasty parting gift that wreaks havoc and leaves the throne empty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the next twenty years, up to the &quot;present&quot;, The Empress&#039; Honor Guard have ruled the Empire, now calling themselves the Lord Generals...and they&#039;re a little crazy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A helpful sidebar informs us that Iron Dynasty has largely removed the class system typically found in feudal oriental societies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good set-up, told concisely, not overly verbose...and sets up a Ronin vs Crazy Empire With Guns And War Machines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PATHS TO UNDERSTANDING&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As is common in Savage Worlds books (and deservedly so) the character creation chapter begins with a listing of common character types for the setting...and we&#039;re talking pages worth. So if you&#039;re stuck for an appropriate concept, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is followed up with nine sample characters of different concepts. Additionally, the book points out five &quot;roles&quot; that should be fulfilled. The upside of Savage Worlds is that it is EXCEEDINGLY easy to toss an NPC into a role to fill in a skill/knowledge gap without the game becoming cumbersome. The recommended roles are Talker, Healer, Infiltrator, Thinker, Warrior.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHARACTER CREATION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, woops...it is it&#039;s own chapter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Humans are your only choice in the game, and they get a free Edge of Heroic Rank or less to start with, amping the power level up a bit, which is certainly fine for the setting. Otherwise, character creation is largely the same as in other Savage Worlds games.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is also recommended that the PCs get &quot;defining interests&quot;, which are similar to the Common Knowledge bonuses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We get a few new Hindrances, a couple of which are familiar from other sources but wholly appropriate for the setting, such as Prideful...(a villain with Prideful will never deliver a finishing blow, for example).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Edges are where the setting really pops, as we get three new Arcane Backgrounds, which inform us that we&#039;re getting some new powers as well. They can be roughly categorized as mad scientists, priests and wizards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not surprisingly, there are all kinds of new Combat Edges in the game, like the impressive Arrow Cutting, which allows you to use your Parry score against physical missiles fired at you, rather than the standard TN of 4. Another nice one is Scabbard Block, allowing a swordsman to use his scabbard as a shield. Silent Kill is another great one: If your Ninja (or whoever) kills a foe unnoticed in a single round, they can either attempt to hide the body quickly, or pin it in place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a LOT of new Edges...my biggest disappointment here is that there are no new Legendary Edges, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ARMS &amp;amp; EQUIPMENT&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The equipment chapter begins with a conversion chart for money, which can be helpful if, among other things, you want to buy something that didn&#039;t make it into the book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Helpfully, there are a lot of images and descriptions of armor and weapons, so that you can tell what they are. Seriously, I love this for any game that uses either non-standard equipment or non-standard naming conventions. It may seems like a little thing, but it&#039;s not. Having a page of illustrations for the various armors is tremendously useful. In addition, there are four different &quot;grades&quot; of equipment, modifying the prices and giving bonuses and penalties are appropriate. For the weapons that are essentially just renamed from common western names, a handy translation guide is present as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All in all, props for the equipment chapter for the little things as much as the big things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SETTING RULES&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every Savage Setting typically stands apart because of the setting rules, which modify the core rules a bit to evoke an appropriate feel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of these are minor: Guts is removed in place of a Spirit check for fear effects and the like. Some Edges are modified or outright excluded, or replaced by new Edges. A couple of new uses for existing skills are listed, like using Intimidation to interrogate and Persuasion as both a Disguise skill and too perform seduction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are also Extended Trait Checks, which are reminiscent of Skill Challenges from D&amp;amp;D4e, and will probably be of much interest to some SW players.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
KEY ELEMENTS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here we get some new powers, as well as one important tweak: Speak Language now lets you talk to Nature Spirits.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New powers allow your heroes to banish oni and spirits from the mortal realm, raise the dead(!) (yes, it is a Legendary power), and travel long distances by stepping through dimensions. There are several more powers, giving plenty of options to choose from for the Arcane Background types.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A new Reputation system is included that can range from -100 to +100 and provides a benefit depending on your ranking. Agt -60, for instance, you essentially have the Mentor Edge, where followers seek you out to learn from you...at +95, you have a Sidekick showing up to help you out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also get Dueling rules, which have several pages of guidelines (and no, are not the same rules from Deadlands, which would feel out of place here). Duels can influence your Reputation, whether by winning, losing, accepting or refusing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also get a little more detail on black powder weapons such as firearms, grenades and the like and some useful guidelines on calculating troops for using the Mass Battle rules (which I&#039;m a big fan of, personally, and love the opportunity to use in SW).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
KONOYO: THE KNOWN WORLD&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now we getting into the setting chapter proper, starting with the five races of people in Konoyo, and how they differ in appearance, dress, etc. Note: This is race in the classic Our World sense, not in the classic Fantasy World sense. Everyone&#039;s still human.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nine provinces are also laid out, each getting about a page, detailing their economy, legal system, allies, enemies and even the common outlook of the people. Like with the background in the beginning, I applaud the author for their verbage here: They never go long winded, giving you the details and getting out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SECRETS OF THE SENSEI&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thus would be the GMing section...specifically, the somewhat more detailed information on each Province with cities, factions and places of interest, as well as plot seeds that can be used as inspiration or misdirection. Again, this section could easily go long winded...God knows a lot of game books do...but not so here. For me, at least, the level of detail feels about juuust right...because if you&#039;re hitting me with a wall of setting text, it better be some amazingly interesting stuff. Here, we get enough information to use any part of the world, though a little work has to go into all of it, because it&#039;s not meticulously detailed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
KESSHI TALES&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What&#039;s one way to sell me on a book? Include a random adventure generator...which this does. It feels similar to the one in Solomon Kane, but expanded, especially with a few tables specific to the setting, which is awesome. You can roll up the premise of the adventure, the mcguffin, the basic location, the supporting cast...all of the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also get a system for designing &quot;Corrupted&quot;, who are people that have been...er...corrupted by dark mojo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Templates are provided for Lesser and Greater Oni, as well as &quot;Yokai&quot;, with random tables that can be used to further modify them for effect. Finally, we get four Monstrous Templates that can be added to most creatures: Clockwork (clockwork samurai FTW!), Demon-Blooded, Ghostly and Kami-Possessed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CAMPAIGN FRAMEWORKS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seven campaign frameworks are included, with recommended character types, adversaries, locations, rewards, etc. Each framework is given a set-up and a sample plot progression that could be developed into Plot Points with a little work. The first one is Heroes of the People with a story arc called The Seven, Oh, Y&#039;Know...and is a band of, say, samurai summoned to help, say, a village against, say, bandits...although their plot arc includes 90% more demons than The Seven Samurai did.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fields of Blood is all about battlefield conflict, in which the heroes rise from footsoldiers to battlefield generals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vengeance is Mine should be a REALLY self explanatory campaign type, and so on. While these aren&#039;t the most useful for actually laying out individual adventures, they do a nice job of relaying the depth of the setting and helping to structure a campaign.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PEOPLE OF KONOYO&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are your stock NPC stat blocks for various walks of life and so forth. Seven pages, from Animal Handlers to Yakuza. Pretty much most of what you&#039;re going to need is present here, for killing or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CREATURES OF KONOYO&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, monsters...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Starting with the spider-like Baku, through elemental spirits and even common animals. Iron Dynasty doesn&#039;t just leave you at the mercy of using random monsters, instead providing many options for you, demonic and otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THE MIGHTY KIKAI&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This would be the section on the giant war machines...we get basic information on light, medium and heavy kikai...with word that more will be coming in The Art of War, apparently an upcoming supplement. There is enough information here to use the three stat blocks, and since it&#039;ll be illegal for most PCs to have one, this is probably sufficient information.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
TWENTY MYSTIC RELICS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is kind of a self explanatory chapter...being about twenty mystic relics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have weapons like a bone spear made from the leg of an oni, a flute that can jog people&#039;s memories, a mask that can grant a lion&#039;s roar, an orb that can raise the dead and a lucky stone that grants the owner a benny at the beginning of the session as well as any time they draw a Joker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, we get an extensive index and a full color map.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The PDF is bookmarked, searchable, copy and paste enabled, has a clickable table of contents and is layered (not that it&#039;s a high end product, graphically speaking, as it is almost entirely black and white).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a credit for the character sheet design, but that seems to be missing from the book...I assume it is on the Reality Blurs website. If so, that&#039;s a minor, but annoying, omission. I&#039;m not a fan of that or the lack of Legendary Edges...in a perfect world, every setting would have at least a couple of Legendary Specific Edges, if for no other reason than to help dispel the annoying misconception that Savage Worlds ends at Legendary. I&#039;m also a bigger fan of the slightly more &quot;westernized&quot; oriental setting found in Wu Xing than I am here, but that&#039;s a personal preference and nothing more. Ultimately, it&#039;s two superficially similar settings with wildly different executions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do like the variety of campaign and character options, the random tables are always welcome, the equipment chapter is *incredibly* well done, tons of new Edges and some cool new powers (including Resurrection, making its first Savage Worlds appearance that I recall seeing).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A very worthy addition to the Savage Worlds library, showing off how SW can do cool martial arts action.</content>

Holy sheez...&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=61050&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Spite: The Second Book of Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt; is 428 pages of horrorific action. The standalone sequel to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=60620&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Dread, The First Book of Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt; (featuring drifters, addicts and criminals waging war against demons) features the good and devout trying to save the world from angels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spite and Dread are designed to stand alone, be used together, or picked and choosed from, with their thematically similar/opposite set-ups.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The scene is set with some visceral art pieces and a series of journal entries featuring a Zealot who is hunting Angels with her team, and then talking about being brutally attacked before being saved by another Zealot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER ONE: PANDEMONIUM&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spite uses D12s, and this the author provides a very good rationale for it, citing how there were 12 disciples, each side of a d12 is a pentagon, etc. That said, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m pumped about needing a bunch of d12s for a game, but we&#039;ll see how this plays out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The premise is simple: You play a Zealot, a once normal person who is now tasked with hunting and killing angels who are, apparently, quite bad. Zealots are formed in Cadres and Cadres answer to Monitors, who are the beings that transform people into Zealots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On 8/8/8 (August 8th, 2008), Angels visited the earth and declared war, killing 1.5 million people. The government hushed it up, let it look like a terrorist attack...but things are just getting started. Monitors are picking up people and turning them into Zealots, giving them the power to hunt and kill Angels, who are here to judge humanity...with either outcome ending life on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Cadres are set up as isolated cells who don&#039;t even know where their Monitors live, for the greater good in case of capture and torture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An overview follows of the things that a Zealot should know, common knowledge provided by the Monitors, including basic information on the types of Angels. Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly, it is not uncommon to have to face cultists who worship Angels as well and, as they are wholly human, that can be hairy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the Angels (a specific subset is what has attacked the earth, actually, The Fallen) get the opportunity, they &quot;judge&quot; a human...giving them the Passion, if they are righteous or The Harrowing if not...either way, nothing remains of their victim.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER TWO: OVERVIEW&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our journal entries continue from before, as our Zealot recalls waking up in the hospital missing her limbs...and regrowing them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here we learn the details of the Disciple 12 system: Roll a number of d12s equal to your skill or ability and take the high roll.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Simple enough, right? Except of you roll multiples, (say, two sixes) you add the number of multiples to the number...(in this case, two sixes equals 6+2 for an 8)...and now, if you had rolled an 8 as well, then getting another 8 in that manner means you have 8+2 for a total of 10. That can get...mindboggling, sometimes. There is also the &quot;Cool Rule&quot;, where you can gain an extra die for describing your actions in a cool manner. I&#039;m okay with that, so long as it doesn&#039;t get abused...(the game slowing down as every action gets an elaborate description).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spite provides a decent list of inspirations, specifically TV shows (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dexter, Angel and X-Files stand out, as do Sons of Anarchy and 24), fiction and music.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTERS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More journal entries, as our POV character finds out what the fight actually is...and then it&#039;s off to character creation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Zealots have short code names, having given their old lives the heave-ho. So come up with something quick and pithy, and bypass the &quot;Bob Jenkins&quot; type names.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, you need a Persona, of which there are (officially) five: Crusader, Leper, Messiah, Prophet and Sinner. Each has a specific approach to the mission, and each has two special abilities that they grant to the PC...such as the Messiah drawing all attention to them or the Sinner being able to automatically take down (or kill) a normal human.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are three attributes, on a scale of 1 to 6: Strength, Sense and Soul...eessentially a physical, mental, spiritual split. You have 9 points to divide among them, and whatever comes out the highest is pretty much your character class, of which there are Fighter, Investigator and Sorceror, each of which has three powers available to them, and your PC can start with one. Note that they are not all combat abilities, either, but are very much keyed to their roles...the Fighter fights, the Investigator investigates and the Sorcerer casts spells.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The skill list is pretty broad, and is ranked like the Attributes. You wind up with a number of skill points equal to twice your Sense score. In addition to descriptions of the skills, there are helpful ideas as to jobs your PC may have performed because of the high skill scores.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next is your Drive, which is a single word that serves as the major motivating factor for your hero. If you can tie an action into your Drive, you get a bonus die.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, you select two Contacts that you can call on throughout the campaign.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, every PC has 12 Fury points, which can be used for Stunts and to fuel Powers...here we get a helpful list of Stunts like Bloody Sanchez (an incredibly bloody combat maneuver which allows the player to reroll anything less than a 4).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Buying stuff is handled with Cash dice. At the beginning of each adventure, you roll your Cash dice (generally starting with 1) and that&#039;s how many points worth of gear you can acquire...and all gear has a point cost attached to it. I like it. I&#039;m totally cool with abstracted wealth systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER FOUR: MAGIC&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the journal entries, our POV character meets the rest of her Cadre for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Time in the game is measured in Cases, not in days, weeks, hours, etc. Your Zealot starts a case and runs themselves ragged until it&#039;s finished. Zealots get a number of spells equal to twice their Soul score and can cast a number of spells per case equal to their Soul score.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The spells are given a one word summary for a quick skim and pick list, and then are described in full over the next several pages. Some example spells are Absolution (allows you to create armor around an ally), Alter (a demon erupts from your bowels and attacks the opponents), Baptism (surrounds a target in water...and can drown them), Confessor (forces the target to answer three Yes or No questions), Judgement (creates a giant plant demon), and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, we get Anathemas, which only Sorcerers can access, and which are designed to exorcise Angels who are possessing humans. It is worth noting that each one is named after a fairly infamous demon such as Belial or Asmodeus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blasphemies are the purview of Fighters, and they are...disturbing...like Vituperation, which causes the casters(!) hands and feet to turn into two large, fleshy poles from which the caster is suspended...but the mere sight of this causes all humans who witness it to do harm on themselves until the effect ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Desecrations are used by Investigators and have such charming effects as compelling every human in the area to rush a targeted Angel, at least some of which will be meeting their doom in doing so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maledictions belong to Sorcerers, who have subtle effects like plucking the souls of city&#039;s murdered into their body and becoming hulking beasts with spikes and tentacles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have to say...the magic in the game is certainly visceral.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER FIVE: COMBAT&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Initiative is handled with everyone rolling one die and starting with the high roll. No attributes affecting it or the like. There are attack rolls and defense rolls, and damage applied is the difference between the two. If the attack and defense rolls are tied, you move to the next highest on each until there isn&#039;t a tie. If there are multiple ties and the attacker runs out of dice, the attack fails. If the defender runs out of dice, and is an NPC, then they have a defensive value of 0...but if the defender is a PC, then the attack still fails, presumably because they have plot immunity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spite is not for the faint of heart, and so injuries are meant to be described, based on severity. A handy chart is provided for tips. Once Life hits 4 points, then penalties start coming into play for the wounded. If the Zealot&#039;s Life reaches 0, they are &quot;retired&quot;...what that means is that their Life immediately returns to 12 AND their Fury doubles to 24...they pursue the end of their case and then the player narrates their demise as their will collapses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I dig this, as it gives the whole &quot;cinematic death&quot; thing, but it justifies it within the context of the setting: Zealots are altered by Angels to do this stuff...when it&#039;s time to go, they go out strong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER SIX: ADVANCEMENT&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here we get experience awards and how to spend them. You can improve skills, add skills, add powers, add magic, improve attributes and create items.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Item creation comes in three flavors:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aspergilia - Common weapons imbued with your life force and given Kewl Powerz&lt;br /&gt;
Osteons - Items created from the flesh (or bones) of a dead angel(!)&lt;br /&gt;
War Machines - These are custom badass vehicles, and the whole Cadre pitches in on them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER SEVEN: PREGENS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We get three PCs, the three that have been in the Journals, a Fighter, Investigator and Sorcerer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three Monitors are provided as well, but they just get personalities and not stats.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three Contacts are listed for use or inspiration, as are three Headquarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER EIGHT: QUICKSTART&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m liking the game so far, but...there&#039;s a joke inherent in the Quickstart showing up 168 pages in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have to admit, though, it actually is useful. It&#039;s a recommendation that the first game be designated as a one shot, and it streamlines the character creation process to get in, go crazy, and get out...and if everyone enjoys it, then you come back and make your PCs and really dig into the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER NINE: APPENDIX&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a glossary of game terms, as well as useful game world slang, and a pronunciation guide. It&#039;s worth noting that this is the end of the Player&#039;s section, and everything up through this point is available as a free download.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER TEN: DIRECTION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And here is where the Director takes over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spite sessions are designed with five points, helpfully laid out here: Trigger, Investigation, Conflict, Revelation and Takedown.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trigger: This stage is where you bait the hook for the Cadre, putting them on the path of the Angel they will be hunting.&lt;br /&gt;
Investigation: Here is where they are trying to either find the Angel or find out what KIND of Angel they are dealing with.&lt;br /&gt;
Conflict: This isn&#039;t just conflict with the Angel, but they could raise the hackles of others during their investigation.&lt;br /&gt;
Revelation: Revelations are new pieces of the puzzle to their be Investigated or pieced together leading to the&lt;br /&gt;
Takedown: And this is culmination of the Case, where the Zealots confront the Angel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a lot of good advice here, including reinforcing the one shot mentality for the first game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, the chapter also does a nice job with setting up a Campaign Progression as well, from getting their feet wet to building to a showdown with an ultimate nemesis. It can all be played in a very &quot;Buffy&quot; way...albeit a bit more...hardcore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those who want to go with a more &quot;collaborative storytelling&quot; route, a system is included for &quot;worldbuilding&quot; with everyone, including the Director, getting five points to spend in order to add characters, backstories, alliances and so forth to world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The chapter ends with some campaign variations, in case you don&#039;t want to play Zealots Against Angels To The Death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are even guidelines for running a game that begins before they are attacked by a Seraphim and selected by a Monitor...which I would be sorely tempted to give a go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER ELEVEN: SETTING&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The backstory of Spite plays into the setting of Dread...apparently the Disciples called in Dread are postponing the Final Battle, holding off an invasion by Heaven by killing demons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I won&#039;t spoil any further on this regard...but there is a...tremendous...revelation about the nature of the conflict that would make for an amazing campaign revelation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We get a breakdown of the two major armies, Angels and Demons...as well as hints at a third army, with a &quot;Pshaw, they&#039;re not real&quot;, that sounds like another game (or supplement) that&#039;ll probably never be made now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, a discussion of the themes is present, such as Isolation and Heroism, as well as reinforcing that Spite is meant to be a gruesome game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#039;t mean to feel like I&#039;m shortchanging this chapter...but there is just some stuff that I don&#039;t want to spoil in a review.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER TWELVE: ANGELS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The primary antagonists of the game...here we learn about Angels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some great advice is given on using and describing angels, especially focusing on the effects of Angels on the world around them. They are not natural, and they have serious effects on natural things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Angels have Grace to counter a Zealot&#039;s Fury...and they have ten Benisons, which can crush mere mortals...Zealots stand a chance of resisting their effects. Some of the nicer effects just blast the victims into a catatonic state...it gets decidedly worse from there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seraphim are described in general terms, and then 40 of them are detailed, complete with stats, standard methods of killing and a typical Takedown for that particular Seraphim...and don&#039;t think you&#039;re getting muscular guys with curly locks and feathered wings...these people are creepy and not safe for work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Ophanim are massive monstrosities capable of destroying cities and are absoluely not meant to be fought by rookies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One or two of these things can almost be rationalized as something like dinosaurs...the rest are just bizarre.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Erelim are biomechanical angelic hunters...some of whom appear mostly &quot;normal&quot;, while others, again, veer into the bizarre...with mechanical spider legs or appearing to be almost entirely machine. But these bad boys are sent entirely to hunt and kill half-breeds...like zealots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rephiam are much less dangerous, and less intelligent than the rest. They are meant to be good &quot;introductory&quot; Angels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The chapter awesomely ends with a selection of &quot;normal&quot; monsters like aliens, vampires, werewolves, gargoyles, mummies, etc...you can use them to take a &quot;break&quot;, you can bait-and-switch a &quot;normal&quot; horror game by having the PCs picked off by a Seraphim at the climax and then being saved by their new Monitor and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Very nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER THIRTEEN: HUMANS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s not all monsters and angels, though...sooner or later, your Zealots will have to cross paths with humans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have Apostles (Disciples who have joined the Angels), Saviors (Zealots who have joined the Angels), Antinomians (Disciples who have joined the Demons) and Hellions (Zealots who have joined the Demons)...mechanically, a Disciple is a Disciple is a Disciple, same with Zealots...where they differ are their outlooks and motives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eucharites are humans who have developed a taste for Angel flesh...yeah. The best part is that it almost always has a side effect...and if you are lucky, that side effect will just be death for the Eucharites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Genstructs are humans who have been biological modified through a strange serum and are largely employed by the Department of Defense.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
FATES and ANGELS Operatives are mercenaries who are genetically modified in ways somewhat more stable than Genstructs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A series of Factions are also present, from Angel worshipping cults to government agencies to devil worshippers. Each faction also includes relevant stat blocks for members of the organization.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The chapter ends with a table full of quick statblocks for tons of humans from cops and private eyes to ninjas and samurai.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER FOURTEEN: SCENARIOS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is really more &quot;Scenario&quot;...as a single scenario is laid out in the format mentioned in the &quot;Direction&quot; chapter. Not to spoil too much, but it kicks off with two angels killing a guy who has run afoul of the Russian mob, and has the PCs and the Mob both poking their heads into the incident...and a couple of (relatively) innocents caught in the middle. A nice model for setting up your own Spite cases.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHAPTER FIFTEEN: APPENDIX&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is mostly a chapter of random tables for cooking up scenarios when you&#039;re stumped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As *anyone* who reads my reviews knows, I LOVE random tables. Absolutely freaking love them. There&#039;s also a page of scenario hooks to help you out, followed by a pronunciation guide.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, the book ends with an index, contributor bios, some plugs for other RPG books and a character sheet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THOUGHTS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So...while the book is, admittedly, over the top, and thus not for everybody...it isn&#039;t just relying on shock value to sell it. There are some great ideas in here, and a system that neither feels too clunky nor too &quot;lite&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone out there familiar with the RPG &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=61388&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Heaven &amp;amp; Earth&lt;/a&gt;? This is kind of like that, but without any subtlety. I&#039;m not knocking Spite for that...just saying: Two similiar premises...two completely different executions. While one is a low key investigative game, this one is a balls to the wall, splatterpunk, action hero game...and it seems like a very cool one, in fact. The creator graciously comped me the entire &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=60638&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Books of Pandemonium bundle&lt;/a&gt; (six books for under $15) and I&#039;ll be eagerly devouring Dread now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I recall hearing that Mr. Chandler, for his own reasons, basically left RPGs...leaving the books available, just said that there wouldn&#039;t be any more. If Spite is any indication, that&#039;s our loss as gamers. He&#039;s also a swell guy, because the proceeds from the sales of all of his currently available books go to the Noel Orphanage in Choimim, Kenya...that means that buying this awesome RPG (and its sister RPGs) goes to a good cause.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So...what are you waiting for?</content>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=84886&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Public Enemies&lt;/a&gt; is the first &quot;modern day&quot; ICONS release…                    </summary>
                    <content type="html">
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TL04H-n7bMI/AAAAAAAAAJY/PZlBMJK-VQ4/s1600/publicenemies.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TL04H-n7bMI/AAAAAAAAAJY/PZlBMJK-VQ4/s1600/publicenemies.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=84886&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Public Enemies&lt;/a&gt; is the first &quot;modern day&quot; ICONS release from Vigilance Press, set in the same world as their World War II releases, just in modern times. It is a villain folio, focusing entirely on big, big bads. Every person here is meant to be a threat to be taken seriously.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The art, by the Louis Porter Jr. design crew, all has a very &quot;90s&quot; feel to it, and if you read comics, you probably know what I&#039;m talking about. Lots of armor, grittiness, scars and ponytails. That&#039;s not a criticism, just an observation. Though not every piece was done by the same artist, there is a uniformity (is that a word?) to the art, giving it a distinctive feel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the introduction, we learn that Alcatraz has been converted into a Super Prison...although no one is sure exactly WHEN that happened...appparently supers have been locked away there since before the prison as we know it was shut down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Presumably more of the setting will be revealed over time, as bits and pieces keep getting dropped here and there, such as something about the Scion, who are apparently an alien race that attacked the earth. This is relevant due because it ties into the backstory of Armory, the first villain on the list. She reminds me a bit like what would happen if Screaming Mimi had gotten the Moonstones instead of Karla Sofen (and if you don&#039;t read Marvel Comics, that sentence was lost on you).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Atrocity is the first callback to the World War II books, as he was the head of a program trying to duplicate the Eugenics program...now he&#039;s a nearly mindless, rampaging giant of a monster. After being turned loose on aliens, he&#039;s now even scarier. All I&#039;m saying is, if you and your players thought Troll was a tough fight from the corebook? Eeeeesh...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, we meet Brainstorm, the Smartest Man Alive...and yeah, he probably is. Note that while he&#039;s not the physical juggernaut you expect from worldshaking villains, his Stamina IS still stacked, due to his willpower.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember how Plastic Man was a small time hood? Now picture him as a ruthless assassin. That&#039;s Garrote. He may sound like a joke, but he&#039;s got some scary stats.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Equinox are four elemental themed villains, genetically engineered to survive on other planets. They cover Earth, Air, Fire and Cold, instead of Water, with an even male-female split. My main gripe here is that we find out how they were created, but they are not mindless creatures and we don&#039;t really get anything on THEM...in fact, they have no Qualities or Challenges, except Gale Force, who is the CEO of Equinox Industries. (They do have Team Qualities and Challenges, but that doesn&#039;t tell us anything about them as individuals, making it hard to look at them as anything but a collection of powers).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ground Zero actually isn&#039;t a villain...he&#039;s just a threat to all life on Earth, aside from Atrocity. He&#039;s also an incredibly interesting character because of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Hollow Men are a group of superpowered homocidal killers led by a man who claims to be from the future, and his collected his band of maniacs to drive the population down below 1 billion. Unlike Equinox, these guys are pretty well developed...with Frazier absolutely convinced that he&#039;s only doing what is best to protect humanity from itself...and most of his killers seem to agree.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Omega is a CIA spook turned supervillain after acquiring an amazing weapon...and then turned themselves in so that USHER (this world&#039;s equivalent to SHIELD) could protect them from the creators of the amazing weapon...&#039;cause they kinda wanted it back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Overtone started off as a hero...until the other heroes realized that he meant to clean up the streets via murdering villains instead of locking them away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shillelagh is one of the fey folk, but he doesn&#039;t look like any kind of fey you typically see, bearing more of a resemblance to Hercules, physically speaking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skullcap is a soldier gone mad, who had has body heavily modified until he&#039;s now superhuman. Reminds me a bit of Crossbones from Captain America, upgraded to an A-list villain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stigma is the grandson of Big Ben (from the Crown Guard), and the twin brother of the current Big Ben...they kinda wound up on opposite ends of things, as comic book twins tend to. In a nice twist, he was scarred in battle with his brother and no matter how his face is repaired, his scar reappears every time he uses his growing powers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, we have Tower, who is a homocidal robot built by The Savant (who is apparently a former ally of USHER, and perhaps the only man as smart as Brainstorm...and not currently imprisoned in Rock City, hence his lack of inclusing in this book).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once again, Vigilance Press impresses me with another strong entry, and their largest one to date. I&#039;m curious to see if we are getting a full setting book, or more small supplements building a larger picture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As for the book itself, several of the villains have no HARD ties to a setting...I mean, almost all of them have &quot;Enemy: USHER&quot;...but you could cut that out and replace it with the government watchdog agency of your choice. Others, you might have to tweak a bit more if you wanted to use them in your own setting as opposed to this one...(not tweak mechanically, other than changing the odd Challenge like Enemy: USHER, just tweak backstories)...Stigma is probably the one most heavily tied to the setting. Even Atrocity could have his backstory switched up with little effort if you wanted to remove him from the WWII-verse Vigilance Press has laid out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you like ICONS, get this. If you like supers stuff, it may still be worth it for idea mining, given the price point. As for me, I could see myself piecemealing a setting together from various ICONS products...</content>

&lt;br /&gt;
Full bookmarked, fully searchable, layered, with a table of contents AND extensive index, each of which are ALSO fully clickable. Even at 300 pages, there is no reason not to be able to navigate all around this PDF with ease...so, strong first impression right there. The book is black and white, with some nice, atmospheric pieces of art.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m not gonna lie...I don&#039;t have a ton of experience with cyberpunk role playing, but attaching it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=51078&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to get me hooked, as I would try pretty much anything at least once under Savage Worlds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
INTRODUCTION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The introduction starts with a three(!) page glossary of common lingo in the world of Interface Zero in 2088. Some of it is lingo being used now &quot;n00b&quot;...others, like TAP, are native to Interface Zero. (TAP is a microchip stuck inside everyone&#039;s head...or pretty much everyone, at least). I won&#039;t go into massive detail here, but yeah, three pages of lingo. For a casual game, might be a bit much...but it is aided by, again, some common terms that exist today, as well as common terms from cyberpunk fiction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The opening fiction is nice, too...with an artificial life form waking up. Sets the stage very well and drew me right in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
HISTORY 101&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the timeline of events, starting from 2010 and ending in 2088, to show where the world went to pot. It chronicles the rise of the corporations, which is hasted by the collapse of governments. We get the standard &quot;oil bad&quot; argument, though I did like how eco-terrorists only made it worse by unleashing an oil eating bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In May of 2028, the Middle East finally erupts into a nuclear war...which in turn causes India to unleash nuclear weapons on Pakistan...which led to near cataclysmic fallout that ultimately killed about 1/7th of the population.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rising sea levels push population centers inward, and about ten years later, the world comes out of The Death (as the fallout was called) changed...but intact. In 2060, the US finally gets a President from Oklahoma, but of course he&#039;s a tyrant who wants to rule with an iron fist, sparking a new civil war.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Humans are replaced in the workforce by simulacrums...but economic conditions have not improved to where humans can afford NOT to work...thus people are scraping by, starving, and blaming simulacrum for it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through all of this, humanity is not only gradually expanding into space, but they are expanding into virtual reality and &quot;hyper reality&quot; as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is just a VERY broad generalization of the world&#039;s history, which runs about 11 pages, in well-written, easily digestible &quot;Timeline&quot; format.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once we hit 2088, the book goes into greater detail, through the voice of &quot;Billy Black Eyes&quot;, who tells us about the world as it is today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We learn that due to modern technology, the rich are functionally immortal, while the poor are pretty much screwed. The middle class has vanished, and you&#039;re either wealthy, or you&#039;re living on ugly, dirty streets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, remember that part about how the rich are functionally immortal? It&#039;s because they are allowed to &quot;dub&quot; themselves...making back-up copies of themselves, essentially.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Humanity&quot; now encompasses humans, Humans 2.0, simulacrums, hybrids and androids, all of which we will get into later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Genetic engineering is commonplace, from people who rewrite their DNA for the traits that they prefer (plastic surgery to the next level), to people who are spliced with animal DNA to become human-animal hybrids.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parts of the world are also pushing for the Omega Protocols, which would help prevent the fear that an AI would evolve beyond human understanding, and essentially become a bigger threat to humanity than anything before it. Many nations are skeptical...I can see how that would be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The virtual world is accessed through the TAP, which virtually everyone has implanted in them, and which is also called &quot;Interface Zero&quot;...if that tells you how important the TAP is to the game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, in 2088 people with psychic powers have suddenly emerged...and no one is quite sure why they are how they are, with theories being that they were genetically engineered, or that they had latent abilities awoken by their TAP.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The history section is very atmospheric, and does a nice job setting the stage for the nihilistic dystopia of Interface Zero.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SYSTEMS OF CONTROL&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are some of the setting rules for Interface Zero, starting with the combat system, which uses the grittier rules of The Moscow Connection, meaning that no one can make soak rolls! As well, a character can become Incapacitated off of a single wound!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, we get to Cyberware, which comes in four &quot;grades&quot;: Gutterware, Streetware, Hyperchrome and&lt;br /&gt;
Milware, inn ascending order of worth. If you need cyberware, you can get the cheap stuff...but there will almost certainly be consequences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rather than just having a list of items, IZ provides a list of effects...you can add effects onto each piece of cyberware, but over a certain point, you have to start adding defect points. And the cheapie stuff starts off with defects anyway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The effects come in three levels, with level 1 providing such diminishing the chance of hitting an innocent or ally with firearms, redundant organs, night visions optics and +1 sub-dermal armor. Level 2 effects include emotion blockers (resisting Taunts and Tricks), personal airbags(!) and retractable claws. Level 3 effects include jump jets, a vehicle control interface and chameleon skin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Defect points are penalties to cybertrauma rolls, which come up when your cyberparts get banged around. A handful of sample cybernetics are included as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From there, we get a list of the Edges and Hindrances that are removed from the setting (like anything arcane), as well as details on how some of the existing edges have been modified.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Connections, for example, are a much bigger deal in this setting than they are in a lot of others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I won&#039;t go into heavy detail on the Hacking rules, but this is where we learn a lot about the TAP, Hyper Reality (the computer reality overlaid onto the real world) and Virtual Reality (the cyberworld). I have to admit that this took a couple of readings, due mostly to outside distractions combined with all of the specific terminology used. One thing that I thought was very cool, though, is that IZ uses Hyper Reality to explain &quot;Hollywoood Hacking&quot;...that is, a good hacker in Interface Zero can hack pretty much *anything*, including vehicles and weapons. In fact, reality is pretty maleable for a great hacker, due to the Hyper Reality overlay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Street Cred rules help govern how you can call on your connections and gain assistance from them, with every character getting two free favors per rank, plus one for every 10 Street Cred points they have. Characters can call in more than that, but their reputation starts taking a hit over that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A handy chart is provided showing Street Cred modifiers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of handy charts, the chapter ends with a handy cheat sheet of all the Hacking/Cyber Combat/Programming rules.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHARACTER CREATION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
IZ starts the character creation chapter off a little different than the normal Savage Worlds book. Rather than targeting character concepts, it encourages you to approach the group concept first, along with common themes for those groups, and THEN individual concepts. Some of the group concepts include gang members, military, troubleshooters and hackers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character creation is pretty standard stuff, beginning with race...and yes, there is more than just human.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, you can play a Human, which follows the standard rules.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Androids are an option, and they have the Construct monstrous ability.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Humans2.0 are the genetically bred humans...and they may be a bit much. In their racial abilities, they have four &quot;pros&quot; to two &quot;cons&quot;...I could see the argument for dropping the free Edge for Humans2.0, with everything else they get.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hybrids are pretty cool, being a mix of human and animal DNA. It is essentially the Fantasy Race creation rules, though you are meant to hew to a specific animal theme. Luckily, a series of packages for common animals are also provided. Although, Hybrids gain a free Edge on top of everything else and, again, I&#039;m not sure I would allow that myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A simulacrum is a biological construct designed for work, recreation or combat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hacking is officially added as a Skill, and it makes sense given how prevalent it is in the setting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One new step is Occupations...you are expected to name your character&#039;s job, which determines their starting credits, as well as the amount of credits gained with each Advance. Additionally, suggested contacts and Edges are listed for each profession.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Several new Edges are present, such as Emancipated, which frees an Android, Simulacrum or Hybrid from their owner. Gun-Fu Edges give you some neat tricks when using Guns in close combat, with Gun-Fu Legend allowing you to Aim while moving! Several IZ-specific professional Edges are present, as is a list of Hacking Edges.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three Hindrances are included, and two of them are HUGE: Unplugged (you start without a TAP!) and Shell Shock (you start every combat Shaken!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A handy summary table of all of the new Edges and ends the chapter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I dig the races, although I would definitely cut out the Free Edge for everthing that isn&#039;t a baseline human or Simulucram. A free Edge is incredibly versatile, so to have that as well as other Kewl Stuff is a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GEAR&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love this chapter...not because I&#039;m a die-hard gear junky, but because it is written as a &quot;Malmart 2088 Spring Catalogue&quot;. Every item gets its stats...but in goofy, over the top, catalogue entry form.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My favorite armor is, by far, the Executive Decision Business Suit: A business suit that provides armor protection AND a potential bonus to the Exec&#039;s first attack while wearing it (if they are taking the opponent by surprise).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Butterfly Sword, Chain Sword and Rockeet Hammer are all pretty impressive in the mail order weapons department.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The guns are absolutely frightening, ESPECIALLY with the lack of Soak Rolls. I mean we are talking some craziness, like pistols doing 2d8 damage to small burst templates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Experimental energy weapons are also available, as is a large listing of vehicles from cars, to motorcycles to hovercraft.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A selection of Golemmechs is included, which is the IZ term for mecha. A list of standard features starts it off, and then five specific mechs are presented.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Malmart also &quot;sells&quot; cyberware from a variety of dealers, including Doc Pango, a street doc who is going global and sells &quot;affordable&quot; cyberwear...just, you know, good luck with that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A handful of drugs follow, complete with addiction rules. To make it doubly bad, you can gain noticeable benefits from drugs...providing a compelling reason to use them in certain circumstances. Not a huge deal if you have a high enough Spirit, though, in some cases.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Gear chapter veers into some nice &quot;flavor&quot; entries, like Dominator Pizza, which puts their delivery people through a rigorous, 13 week training camp under grueling conditions so that they can make sure you get your pizza in the urban sprawl in under 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s also good to know that, in the future, Deadlands is an incredibly popular MMO...and I gotta say, this gave me the crazy idea of having...something...come through the MMO into reality for an IZ game. Stone, maybe? NAH...that would be far, far too much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Gear chapter is very extensive, with a lot of examples of each type of entry, yet written in an interesting manner (while still being easy to find the relevant game mechanics). I&#039;m not one to out and out cheer for an equipment chapter, but this was very nicely done, providing some cool, over the top options in an entertaining manner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WORLD OVERVIEW&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The chapter begins with the Central African Union whose story is, honestly, kinda inspiring. After oil collapsed, Africa was left to fend for itself...and rather than die out due to AIDS and poverty, it got tore down and then rebuilt itself as a viable power in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Simulacrum in South Africa are treated to the worst of the racism and slavery that blacks suffered under the South African rule...this opens up some interesting arguments for a game set in and around the Central African Union, though they are some touchy subjects.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Chinese Mandarinate is the top superpower in the world, but rules entirely by economic power and not military power, having decommissioned their military and now propping up the states under their rule. They have also been working heavily on a solution for the population issue, by attempting to genetically engineer children that will lose all gender characteristics at puberty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Techno-Shogunate Japan is home to the world&#039;s oldest living human population, with a workforce made up almost entirely from simulacrum, which outnumber the humans in Japan now. However, the simulacrum bred in Japan are also the most &quot;human&quot; Simulacra out there, as they are not raised ENTIRELY in tanks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Greater Eurasian Union doesn&#039;t sound too shabby...with boredom apparently being the biggest problem. Although human nature + boredom does tend to = bad news.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The India League became a series of city-states after the nuclear fallout hit and pretty much killed farming, and India has also become THE entertainment capital of the world over the last 20 years, especially when California finally completely collapsed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Middle East is more peaceful than it has ever been...mostly because it is a radioactive wasteland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
North America has gone from three countries to nine, as the US, Canada and Mexico have all broken apart into smaller countries in the wake of the changes over the last several years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oceania are the island countries of the Pacific, where many people fled to as the rest of the world was collapsing, including the man-made island MU - so named as a tribute to the mythical Atlantis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Brazil has come to largely dominate South America in most ways...and outside forces seem to be bitter at just how little Brasilia seems to have suffered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Free City of Chicago is covered in detail, as an example of the Free Cities in what used to be the US right now. Chicago has grown in size, and is now divided into four major sectors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Central Chicago is home to the business district, as well as the Gold Coast, designed for the affluent. It also houses the Eden Complex, which was meant to be an underground population center, but the criminal elements have begun to overrun it, and it is now &quot;Coffin City&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The North Side is Neo Suburbia, a place you can go to escape the craziness of the inner city.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The South Side is also known as Urban Hell, and is actually outside of what used to be Chicago proper, as the former Gary, Indiana is smack in the middle of Urban Hell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last is the Wild, Wild West side...which is still a nicer place to be than the South Side. Chicago has a 48% unemployment rate, which also means there&#039;s a pretty big crime rate. Several street gangs are mentioned in this section, starting with the Chrome Reapers, who will jack your cyberwear...yeah, out of your body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, there is no police force any longer...just contracted security forces. Well, there is the Chicago Defense Force...but they are only deployed for ABSOLUTE emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The chapter also covers the major corporations and entertainment sections of Chicago, providing a lot of good information for launching a campaign set in Chicago, or using it as a template for your own Free Cities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GAME MASTER SECTION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of the information here is pretty standard stuff for a GMing section, although the &quot;conflict&quot; section is nice, as it gets into some of the broader conflicts available in a cyberpunk setting, like Reality vs Virtual Reality, Megacorps vs Megacorps and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A large section is devoted to controlling cash flow in your game, which is a much bigger deal here than in a lot of games, as cash can rule EVERYTHING. In fact, a handy table is provided that not only breaks down the common jobs for each character rank, but the standard payouts for those jobs. A number of tips are also provided for keeping available money down, including guidelines for &quot;Cost of Living&quot; expenses to be deducted from the characters&#039; cash balances.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While there is a LOT of great advice for capturing the bleak, cyberpunk &quot;feel&quot;...I absolutely love the Random Adventure Charts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seriously...very little fills me with joy like Random charts. Using d12s, you can generate a Contractor for the job, the Mission itself, Urban or non-Urban locations, the MacGuffin (if needed, this is an object that is at the center of some missions), Innocents (in some missions, someone may be endangered), the Antagonist, Twists and Complications, and Dramatic Conflict (optional, but awesome).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A Domain Generator is also present, for rolling up a network on the fly, when the PCs start hacking into something you hadn&#039;t prepared for, with a decent list of sample domains, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SAVAGE TALES&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Savage Tales are short adventures, and IZ includes 11 of them, spread among Japan, the Eurasian Union, The India League, The Middle East and North America.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Among the eleven tales are WIDE range of missions and objectives, showing off both the quirks of the setting and the breadth of options available for adventures. My personal favorite starts off with a simple &quot;seek and destroy&quot;, but actually involves a group of awakened Dubs...although the mission to keep Hollywood from rising again is pretty cool, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition, 21 adventure hooks are included, which can be used as inspiration or expanded into their own adventures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, a Bounty Generator is included, which starts with rolling for the target, their crime, the location, the target&#039;s true disposition (guilty/innocent/complicit) and notoriety (the amount of the bounty).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Did I mention I love random charts?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THREATS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are the relevant game stats for the things your PCs are liable to have to fight (or team with).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bio-Horrors are up first, and include Beetle Rats, Cyber Sharks, Toxic Roaches and - yes - random generators for making your own bio-horrors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also included are three sets of stock stats for Cyborgs (including one Wild Card), three types of Gang Members (with a Wild Card), three common Hackers, three Ismist Activists with a Wild Card terrorist leader, three stock Law Enforcement officers, three stock Simulacra, four military sets with two Wild Cards, standard criminal Mooks with two Wild Card underground types, and a number of catch-all stats like Bounty Hunters, Bloggers, Detectives and Media Icons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Five AI programs are included as well, all Wild Cards, with Subsentient Programs that are almost always Extras.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book ends with the fully clickable Index, a Campaign Tracker sheet, a printable sheet of Favor Counters, a page for Program and Domain cards, NPC stat cards and a two page character sheet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THOUGHTS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Impressively comprehensive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do have three gripes: I really think the Free Edge is either given out too often OR, and this may be radical, I would recommend giving baseline humans two Free Edges. Why? Well, the setting is so lethal anyway, why not? And it does give humans a very compelling ability against everyone else. Just a thought. I would definitely give it a go as-written first before changing anything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a ton of terminology to get used to, so I did have to do a bit of re-reading...but that&#039;s something I would get used to over time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, there is a bit devoted to talking about the emergence of the Psions...and they are not mentioned anywhere else in the book. My understanding is that the Psion splat it meant to be the first supplement for IZ, but SOMETHING in this book, even NPC guidelines (saving the PC option for the splatbook), would have been great.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the flip side: Seriously, between searchability, clickable index and table of contents, plus bookmarks? There is no reason not to be able to find something in this 300 page tome. At ALL. Just an amazing bit of work there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And, as I noted above, there is just a TON of material in here. Stats, Edges, information, fluff, rules, jeez...just an incredibly loaded book that&#039;s easy to navigate around to boot...and seriously, I LOVE random charts...the random adventure generator here may even be better than the one for Thrilling Tales. I don&#039;t know how to praise it any higher than that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you like Savage Worlds and cyberpunk, there is no reason not to buy this. There is plenty of information here that you can use to get a game going, and the setting is broad enough that you have a LOT of options to play around with for your campaigns. On top of it, there is plenty of room for expansion in future releases.</content>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=83083&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Blood Moon Rising&lt;/a&gt; is the first adventure for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=64332&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Labyrinth Lord&lt;/a&gt; by Small Niche Games. I&#039;m going to be approaching this from a little different tack: I don&#039;t play Labyrinth Lord or D&amp;amp;D or any of the retroclones. However, I do likes me some adventures, and good ideas can be stolen for other games.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
***WARNING***&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I try to go light in spoilers...BUT...it is impossible for me to leave them out completely. If you are going to be playing in this, do yourself a favor and go away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
***END WARNING***&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blood Moon Rising is set up as a &quot;sandbox&quot;/timeline type adventure for 3-6 characters of 1-3 level. Basically, the book gives you a town with NPCs and a backstory, and the timeline of events that will occur during their big festival celebrating an ancient warrior that they all revere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From there, the PCs interact with whatever they will, until the whole thing is resolved. The action rises, as action tends to do, until the PCs should find it virtually impossible not to realize that something isn&#039;t right (in fact, there is a very nice hook on Day One to draw them deeper into events unless they are completely self absorbed).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love adventures that give you freedom, and this one does from the beginning, not even making any assumptions about the reason the PCs are in the town, just giving you some excuses if you need the help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The background section gives you the backstory of the village, which has mutated considerably until it has become a very...inaccurate...local legend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The village of Garanton is pretty small, about 200 people, and utterly normal for the most part...except for the interesting little spring on the edge of town with strange healing properties...until the New Moon...then I wouldn&#039;t want to bathe in it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Feast of St. Garan is a five day festival celebrating this great warrior that liberated the land, and is presented in the book as a series of events in the manner and order that they will occur, should the PCs not interfere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fifth night of the festival is the Blood Moon, hence the name of the module.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are first presented with the normal order of events, followed by the major events from each day. Warrior types can compete in the Honor Games over the five day period, with the possibility of a title and a sweet, sweet magic item out of the deal. There is also the possibility of Honor Duels, which can be fought using non-lethal damage, to first blood or to the death, if a heated issue spirals out of control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On Day One, the first Honor Game is held, which is a simple test of strength...but characters can discover some helpful clues about the true nature of the festival from the rocks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A potential hook is also set in which a local artist asks the PCs to pose for a portrait...but he&#039;s fated to go missing overnight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Day Two likely starts with news of a local farmer&#039;s cows being slaughtered and the PCs missing their appointment with the artist, because he&#039;s gone missing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Day two also provides a Test of Nerve in the Honor Game, which has the potential to set the PCs on a collision course with an orc tribe that has become drawn to the area. Overnight, the a farmhouse is attacked by creepy demons (who killed the cattle the night before), further escalating tensions and making the mood somber.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Day Three Test of Steed can provide slight financial benefit for a participant, but no plot-worthy extras like the first two days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Day three also ratchets up the tension with the first human casualties, at least one of which is not what it seems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Day four provides the opportunity for the PCs to uncover the truth about one of the attacks, as well as a possible battle that can turn them into instant heroes. However, the growing darkness over the events are driving people away now, before the end of the festival.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, on Day Five, the Honor Games will conclude and - that night - a nasty group of demons attack the village. If the PCs have stuck around, they have a chance of driving off the demons...if not, the village is slaughtered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It sounds simple enough, but there&#039;s plenty of action and excitement for a rookie party over a few sessions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Twenty random encounters are also present, which include large, drunken women hitting on the PCs and not taking &quot;No&quot; for an answer, a young warrior being hazed, a fan club for one of the PCs, the possibility of scoring a very special mount and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another series of encounters are present for those leaving the village, including the possibility of investigating the Tomb of St. Garan (and finding the good &quot;saint&quot; to be a sealed away undead Wight), as well as precisely what can happen if the PCs venture to the Demon Gate that is releasing the night demons on the village, and lays seeds for continuing adventures with much more powerful beasties trying to break through the gate (for when the PCs are higher level, of course).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final resolution of the adventure is up the PCs, depending on what they did and how much exploration they indulged in, as they could uncover the truth about the area&#039;s history (effectively ending the annual festival), inadvertantly unleash an undead plague on the land to go with the demonic one, and allow an infernal beacon to draw all manner of evil to the area (if they don&#039;t destroy the Demon Gate).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All of the important (and semi-important) NPCs are given stats and summaries, and an appendix provided adds in a new spell (Lesser Charm Monster), as well as a pair of magic items (the Mantle and Sword of St. Garan) and two new monsters (the Night Demons and Demon Grubs).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My thoughts?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I will never run this as written...because AD&amp;amp;D/Labyrinth Lord/OSRIC/etc do not appeal to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
HOWEVER...I would absolutely convert this to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=51078&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82385&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;High Valor&lt;/a&gt; and use it as a potential launching point for a new campaign. For $4.95 you not only get a good sandbox adventure, you get a potential &quot;home base&quot; for PCs with a couple of plot hooks that could spawn into minicampaigns (or full blown epic conflicts in the case of the Demon Gate and what it&#039;s holding back) down the line.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Very cool stuff, and worth it even factoring in the necessary conversion work I&#039;d have to do (not that High Valor or Savage Worlds would require a ton of work).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Great stuff...better than most of the modules I remember getting back in the day.</content>

War of the Dead Chapter One is the first leg of the War of the Dead campaign epic for Savage&lt;br /&gt;
Worlds by Daring Entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To be clear: Chapter One is actually 13 adventures, of which there will ultimately be 52 (not counting one sheets, which Daring has begun to release). It is a modern setting, set during a zombie outbreak, and you can buy them in bits or you can buy all of Chapter One as a package.&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m going to save you the trouble: Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=51078&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975%20&quot;&gt;Savage Worlds&lt;/a&gt; and zombies? Go buy the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=81548&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/a&gt;. I&#039;ll even&lt;br /&gt;
link to it for you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WARNING: Though I will go as light as I can on spoilers, as I always do with adventures, it is virtually impossible to do a review of substance and also go spoiler free. If you are going to be a player in War of the Dead, do yourself a favor and stay away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SERIOUSLY.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
HERE BE SPOILERS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WEEK 1 TO 3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The PDF is layered, searchable and has a table of contents, and is copy and paste enabled. The book actually begins with important setting notes before getting into adventures. The War of the Dead is specifically inspired by the works of George Romero and Robert Kirkman, so that is the flavor of zombie horror you can expect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The character types available are pretty much anything in a &quot;normal&quot; modern setting, though handy character advice is offered for you, in common archetypes and how they might be affected in the new world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A new Benny rule is provided called Heroic Determination, which allows a PC to spend a benny and get Combat Edge for free for one round.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Four new Hindrances are present (three of which having a Major/Minor scale), such as Responsibility to Others and Guilt. A new Scavenger edge is present as well, which provides a bonus for finding food, supplies and shelter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Several Edges are removed (relating to Powers), and some useful Knowledge skills are mentioned, along with their uses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some character advancement tips beyond Fighting and Shooting are also offered, with a general emphasis on using more than using advancement to boost combat abilities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The GM section provides the &quot;rules&quot; of the zombies...such as how they will not stop coming unless their brain is destroyed, and clarifies that they neither have superhuman strength or senses. The rules also cover the effects of the enviroment and temperature on the undead, with cold causing them to freeze up and dry climates speeding up decomposition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Virtually everyone is susceptible to infection from a zombie&#039;s bite...however, there are odd individuals who are not. This is determined by the GM and not the players, so they can&#039;t just, say, take an Edge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are also guidelines for stopping infection by severing limbs, with the horrific possibility of that STILL not working.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a &quot;random headshot rule&quot;, and it is recommended that PCs not be allowed to call headshots until the effects of a headshot have been witnessed first hand.&lt;br /&gt;
Tips are also given for the use of the Survival and Tracking skills in relation to the game world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is lots of useful setting info here for the GM about incorporating NPCs (and Savage Worlds is system VERY well suited for a &quot;group of survivors&quot; type game).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Week One begins aboard the cruise ship Pinnacle (the first of many easter eggs), setting off on its maiden voyage with 3,000 people on board. In the first act, that night at sea, a Texas oilman takes ill after speaking with the PCs and is taken to the infirmary. Once he savagely attacks his wife and anyone else in the infirmary, the cruise ship turns into a cruise ship from Hell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Act two, the Head of Security Jason Kirkman starts taking control of the situation, and the PCs are sent to their rooms...where they soon hear cries for help from a nearby cabin, leading to another zombie encounter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is all meant to bring the PCs to the attention of the Head of Security, ensuring that they are central figures in the ensuing chaos. The PCs get to witness a power struggle between Kirkman, Ship&#039;s Captain Romero and the ship&#039;s owner Mr. Forthington, hinting that things are about to get even uglier. Week one should conclude with Kirkman and the PCs on a ship rapidly going to Hell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While things are going south here, they are also going crazy out in the world...and the cell networks are clogged up, cutting the PCs communications options down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Week One is a good start, designed to familiarize the PCs with the situation before a fairly rapid (but not TOO fast) descent into anarchy, and they are cut off completely from the outside world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Week 2 begins with a grisly scene of panicked passengers being attacked by the undead, with the crowd actively getting in the way if the PCs try to stop the undead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Act two gets crazy ugly as a paramilitary team has attacked the ship out of nowhere, with the PCs stumbling into a fight between them and zombies. The immediate assumption is liable to be that they are involved with the zombies, but far from it: They are on the boat for other reasons altogether, a very nice touch as it already makes the world feel &quot;bigger&quot;, in that not everything is tied directly into either the PCs or the zombies, but still has relevance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Week 3, the ship has been crippled and everything is going to Hell quickly. The adventure opens with a big set piece just designed for Savage Worlds goodness, with the PCs, Kirkman and the remaining soldiers getting to fight 28 zombies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From there, we get to the first in what becomes a very cool recurring theme in the campaign: Encounter charts keyed to card draws. Draw a card for every PC and play through the encounters. Some very awesome encounters are present: A girl who has been bitten by her zombie mom, a man who has snapped and murdered his family and an entire deck that is completely overran by zombies being among my favorite. This all builds the paramilitary subplot to a head as we find out precisely why they are on board.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Act Two, things calm down for the first time, as the known survivors gather together and assess the damage. An homage to the crazy religious lady from The Mist begins rattling the people, and a new encounter chart is used featuring incidents with the survivors, such as a possible suspicious interaction with the paramilitary guys, a random zombie busting in and a depressed man cutting his own throat in the room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Week three ends with a fairly railroady beatdown of the PCs, Kirkman and the armed soldier for plot purposes...I would recommend just giving everyone a benny and moving on. I imagine they&#039;ll be okay enough with that. (Obviously, if you are wrapping up the session there, give it to them at the beginning of the next, just to be nice...they can use it.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, there are a few &quot;cinematic moments&quot; that kick in for the advancement of the plot...for me, at least, rather than ditching these I would just give out bennies any time the narrative took over, &#039;cause it is INCREDIBLY likely that the PCs will need all that they can get.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After the Week 3 section, the rest of the first book is filled with stats of the various Chapter One zombies: Shamblers, Sprinters, Newborns and Generals. Finally, all of the stats for the remaining NPCs in Chapter One, in order of appearance no less, are presented.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I really love that last bit of organization as, among other things, it lets you know that the author&#039;s not just making it all up as he goes along, since this was originally released weekly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, a very strong start to the campaign series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WEEK 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Week 4 begins with the big standoff with the dingbat zealot, and has one of the PC&#039;s allies flipping on them so that he can protect his family from the mob. She is convinced that the zombies only want the &quot;sinners&quot;, but there are dead inside of the auditorium with the survivors that will help flip things on its ear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This provides the PCs and their allies a chance to make their escape, where they discover that a) a Coast Guard ship is coming and b) their paramilitary buddies have wired the Pinnacle to explode and are not sticking around, leading to one more betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, the Coast Guard ship is full of zombies, and is on a collision course with the Pinnacle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This Week ends what is really the first Act or so of Chapter One, as the PCs and any surviving allies manage to escape the cruise ship...only to be stranded at see for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The saga of the cruise ship Pinnacle is a great start to the War of the Dead, with a couple of early &quot;human&quot; breaks in the action...and I love the Encounter Charts being keyed to the card draws. I&#039;ve just always dug stuff like that...I seriously love random charts, and making sense of the results.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WEEK 5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Week 5, after two weeks at sea (thanks to a hurricane and their boat being damaged), the PCs make landfall for the first time since the game began. The first warning that something Just Isn&#039;t Right should be that the communications grid is largely dead. They make landfall at a marina, that just confirms that the whole zombie outbreak is a much larger phenomena (if the Coast Guard ship didn&#039;t clue them in, of course).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This Week also provides their first contact with NPCs after the ship, and is the first Week to focus primarily on a more human problem, rather than a zombie problem, with rampaging bikers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This one also has a plot driven kidnap scenario that is required to set up the next Week. A little railroady, yes, but if they complain too much, give &#039;em two bennies this time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The whole tone is a good change of pace after the crushing saga of the Pinnacle. I do think that the second forced abduction in five adventures was probably spaced too close together, but I also think that a group buying into the &quot;game&quot; won&#039;t mind TOO much, especially with a benny reward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WEEK 6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hopefully the PCs made nice with the elderly couple from Week 5, because they are being used as leverage by the bikers to force the PCs into working for them. The PCs get to be bait, drawing zombies away as the bikers raid a town for supplies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This provides another cool encounter chart, including an opportunity to stock up on weapons, and two encounters featuring low flying aircraft...one of which is armed and doesn&#039;t see the PCs(!).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The PCs also get an RV in this adventure, which his a model in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=83232&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Paper Dead&lt;/a&gt; supplement, complete with removeable roof so that you can see inside AND &quot;zombie proof gear&quot; to affix to the outside!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The raid allows the PCs the chance to escape...but it&#039;ll surely mean taking on the bikers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The PCs also catch a break from a radio broadcast...directing them to a Rescue Station in Jacksonville.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Encounters charts are always awesome, so any chance to bust those out are great. The PCs get a chance to not be whipping boys, and get a cool ride. And yes, in the Zombie Apocalypse genre, RVs are a cool ride.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WEEK 7&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now the PCs get a broader look at how the world has gone to pot in just a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another encounter chart is provided, this time with road specific encounters such as mid-road ambushes, spooked birds, a life threatening flat tire and the possible return of the biker gang the PCs just escaped from!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The RV Plot Device dies, setting up the PCs to meet a group of survivors, including a little girl destined to play a very important role in the overall arc of the story. It&#039;s best to take advantage of the calmed down atmosphere at the moment, to make it all have a little more impact when the church the survivors are holed up in comes under attack from the biker gang *while* a...creepy...zombie outbreak occurs inside the church.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Things descend into an appropriately chaotic mess again, with zombie hordes, bikers and a unique new breed of zombie that will...unsettle some folks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first time I saw &quot;zombie newborn&quot; was in the Dawn of the Dead remake...which came out a few months after my first son was born, after a tense delivery...I nearly walked out of the movie theatre, but I think I was overly sensitive at the time. I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll bother me as much here, and one cool bit is that one of the random encounters in the previous Week can foreshadow this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WEEK 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Week 8 serves, ultimately, to explain just what happened to the government as the group has their first formal encounter with the military, upon arriving in Jacksonville. Before that happens, the survivors of the church are threatened with a huge internal conflict that the PCs get to take sides in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The little girl mentioned in Week 7 is at the center of all of this controversy, as she seems to be infected, but has no wounds or the like. This is a huge point of contention for the survivors, some of who are afraid they are endangering everyone by keeping her around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One gripe with this scenario is that twice the girl in question is placed in a horrible, life threatening situation...but has plot immunity (as she is integral to later chapters). I don&#039;t mind the plot immunity, but two life threatening situations in this adventure for someone who is in no danger seems...excessive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WEEK 9&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Week 9 has the PCs and some military in the ruins of Jacksonville, trying to find medicine for the girl...and begins with three encounters to be spread out, featuring opportunities to aid people in awful situations, with guilt effects if they choose not to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More crazy fun from random Encounter Charts is included, this time focusing on crazy, chaotic encounters in a city in flames. They can get attacked by feral dogs, rescue a woman trapped in her car, get *shot* at and have to deal with an exploding gas main.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If they make it past the zombies and a gun weilding raiding party, they get to return to camp to find out that tensions at home base have completely erupted, resulting in the PCs having to get the Hell out of dodge with whatever allies they have left.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a nice &quot;out of the frying pan, into the fire&quot; adventure, and after two Weeks with the military, they are surprisingly not revealed to be evil, incompetent or traitors...just guys out of their depth a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WEEK 10&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Week 10 provides a huge, and much needed, change of pace: The PCs find an actual community of survivors...and pretty much this whole Week is decompressing, acclimating and so on. Not a ton of action going on in this Week, just a lot of slow build and plot development.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For some groups, this is might be too &quot;slow&quot;. It is definitely not what you expect from a Savage Worlds adventure, but I submit that this is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WEEK 11&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another week of lite-action/heavy-roleplaying as the town&#039;s Mayor is ordering the military contingent that the players found while on patrol to leave, due to them being a drain on resources. This is setting up a large fracture among the survivors, as some (including possibly the PCs) are sure to be on the side of the military, but the father of the young girl who may be infected is far more concerned with utilizing the resources of the town to help his daughter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WEEK 12&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Week 12 begins ratcheting the action back up for the finale, as the PCs find out that the Living Dead have homed in on settlement, and the town has about a day&#039;s notice of their approach. This leads to a supply run at a nearby town...and turns into a race against time as the young girl has gone missing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This leads to a crucial choice for the PCs: They can help defend the town against the undead, which breaks into the mass combat rules...or they can abandon the town to try to rescue the girl, and unearth the secrets that the town has been hiding in the process.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WEEK 13&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The adventure begins with a &quot;surrender or die&quot; scenario, which probably means that the PCs will be abducted for the third time since the plot began. However, some very important information is conveyed here, including the possible origin of the virus that creates zombies, as well as the reason the little girl is so important: She has been infected with the virus, and her body has been fighting off the virus ever since.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This all builds to one more apocalyptic turn of events, putting the PCs back on the road once more, and setting the stage for Chapter Two.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The WEEK 13 book ends with some teasers about what is coming in the future, as some of the past will come back to haunt the PCs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
$20 for 13 adventures and the beginning of an incredibly ambitious campaign for Savage Worlds. It definitely falls closer to the Evernight &quot;scripted campaign&quot; territory than it does the now-famous &quot;Plot Point&quot; campaigns...not saying that&#039;s a bad thing, just saying.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The author plays to the strengths of Savage Worlds throughout Chapter One, as it is one of the few systems that could pull off large set pieces with hordes of zombies and a slew of NPC allies and not really slow down. The cruise ship is strong start, forcing a clausterphobic feel right off the bat. Chapter Two is supposed to begin releasing soon, but in the meantime Daring Entertainment has begun releasing War of the Dead &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=84216&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975%20&quot;&gt;One Sheets&lt;/a&gt;, as well as optional rules inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://http//www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=84303&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975%20&quot;&gt;FATE.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While I don&#039;t hesitate to give this a strong recommendation, I do note that there are a couple of places where the plot hammer does come down awfully heavily. There will be some groups that will chaffe at this. I think my usual group would roll with the punches, especially if I tossed them an extra benny or two for their troubles...as they can usually use them in games where the odds are LESS stacked against them, so they&#039;d love me for them here. I think three forced kidnappings/surrenders/captures in the first Chapter was probably pushing it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are some pieces that are very obvious homages to various films and stories, but I think they are clearly meant to be homages and most folks will get that. The &quot;card draw&quot; random encounter charts absolutely rule it, though, and if I ever start writing Savage Worlds adventures, I will shamelessly steal the concept and incorporate it as often as I can because I absolutely love random tables.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Highly recommended for some Savage Worlds/zombie killing fun. I wish to Hell I&#039;d had this a year ago when I interrupted our Savage Worlds group to try to go back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=627&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;All Flesh Must Be Eaten&lt;/a&gt;. We wouldn&#039;t have bothered.</content>

                    <content type="html">
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TKBA65FvpuI/AAAAAAAAAIY/WqsbE0hCUAA/s1600/wuxing.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TKBA65FvpuI/AAAAAAAAAIY/WqsbE0hCUAA/s320/wuxing.jpg&quot; width=&quot;231&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82054&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Wu Xing: The Ninja Crusade&lt;/a&gt; was a bit of a hard sell for me, being a quasi fantasy game in an oriental mish-mash fantasy culture with a heavy anime influence...that is kind of a laundry list of things I don&#039;t like (except for the fantasy part).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And yet, while I was reading (and loving) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=59016&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Apocalypse Prevention Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, the book&#039;s writer Eloy Lasanta asked me if I would be interested in checking out Wu Xing for a review...off the strength of the API series, I said yes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wu Xing is available in hardcopy from Studio 2 Publishing and in PDF from RPGnow. The core rules are 221 pages with simple cover design and decent amount of black and white art. Like API, you never get the feeling that art is being used to fill space and inflate page count. It uses the Dynamic Gaming System, which is fundamentally simple, with lots of cool combat crunch (making it about spot on for the genre, I think).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...IN BRIEF&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book opens with a one page summary of the game, including the ten Ninja Clans and the clanless Ronin. The whole set-up is very reminiscent of the group set-up in World of Darkness games, so there is probably going to be a hint of familiarity for folks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WHAT IS ROLEPLAYING?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pretty standard &quot;what is roleplaying&quot; section, with a little example, with a Ninja PC trying to end a fight with intimidation and not conflict.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NINJA VS THE EMPIRE&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the setting chapter, and it is a nice setting indeed. Ninjas are kinda like superheros, using their chi to do amazing things that mere mortals cannot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ninja made their first public move during the Crime Rebellion, also known as The First Ninja War, when they crippled the Orime Empire in a guerrilla war.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From there ninja clans as they exist today began, and the kingdoms that arose from the fall of the Orime Empire hired the clans to do their dirty deeds, sparking the Mercenary Wars, also known as the Second Ninja War.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The War of Withered Fangs, or the Third Ninja War, occured when The Slithering Gods began slaughtering other, smaller ninja clans. This one ended when the ninja publicly aligned with kingdoms and the Izou Empire and broke the back of the Withered Fangs, which evolved into the Recoiling Serpents.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Expansion Wars, or Fourth Ninja War, saw an end to the affiliations between the ninja and the Empire as the Empire quickly expanded into ninja lands, taking everything they could. The Emperor outlawed ninjas and public use of chi.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Ninja Crusade, the Fifth Ninja War, is where we are at now...The Empire is hunting and killing ninja at every turn. The ninja have formed the Lotus Coalition to pool resources against The Empire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We get an overview of the ten ninja clans, each of which have a very distinct worldviews and even martial arts, but have a built in reason to work together due to the Lotus Coalition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ninja used to be recruited by blood, but as time has moved on, ninja are now recruited as often as they are born. There is also a bit about the student-master relationship and how the reputation of the master can go with the student, for better or for worse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A very informative discussion follows on how the ninja have set up hidden cities, the basic structure of clan politics and realities of clan rivalries, even with the Lotus Coalition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We get the Lotus Coalition side of things, where they joined forces after the Empire moved to gunpowder fueled weapons and slaughtered ninja for about a year before they they joined forces. The Big Tent of the Lotus Coalition still has a lot of in fighting, and it nearly got torn apart when a groom from The Pack of the Black Moon and a bride from The Recoiling Serpents had their peace-brokering wedding spoiled when the groom was mysteriously poisoned, casting suspicion on the Recoiling Serpents.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also get the history of the Izou Empire, and my favorite part is the Emperor himself. Emperor Izou ascended to the throne at the age of ten and quickly consolidated his power. This continued until his two sons were caught in the crossfire between two ninja clans, leaving the future Emperor dead and the surviving brother seething with rage. This led to the public ban on ninja, which lasted until an undentified clan attacked the Emperor&#039;s wife and daughter, decapitating the former and giving the latter a slow acting, lethal poison...at that point, the war expanded to any chi users and the Ninja Crusade began. The author does a great job of establishing that Emperor Izou is a bastard, but he is also justified in his rage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We get introduced to the class system, which is very important to the setting. The classes start with Commoners, Artisans, Merchants, Warriors and Nobles...with Untouchables being those beneath Commoners, on the outskirts of the Class system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a short bit about religion, which doesn&#039;t play a huge role in the game, but there is a growing religion about a single figure who is greater than any ninja or the Emperor, so that religion sure isn&#039;t too popular in the Empire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A big section follows on the ten provinces of The Empire, with plot seeds built in for use in the game. This is followed by The Five Kingdoms, which are the remaining kingdoms that exist outside of The Empire. Both an Empire map and a World map are included, and the information in the sections provides ample information without bogging the sections down with Too Much Detail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CLANS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the overview of the ten clans, plus the Ronin. The set-up is very similar to how clans, tribes, etc, are treated in World of Darkness games, with the overview and stereotype of each clan, the clan&#039;s thoughts on the other clans, the Ronin, the Lotus Coalition and The Empire, plus clan specific character creation information.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Bamboo Herbalists: The Bamboo Herbalists are healers, but they are far from stodgy, cleric types...they are thrill seeking adventurers, to a fault. However, they are imbued with a resistance against disease and poison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blazing Dancers: Blazing Dancers are often not taken as seriously as the other clans, due to being performers at heart. However, they are very much ninja like the other clans, capable of their own deadliness. They can muster minor magical effects to use to enhance their performances.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Grasping Shadows: These guys are what most people commonly think of when they think of ninjas: Assassins appearing from the shadows and killing their targets. The begin with extra levels in the &quot;core&quot; ninja skills, but REALLY do not play well with the other clans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hidden Strands of Fate: Dirty, dirty manipulators who are very likely playing EVERYONE for fools. They often have hidden objectives within missions and will order their members to sabotage Lotus Coalition missions. They can actually physically manipulate common threads with chi, playing on their nicknames.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Living Chronicle: The Living Chronicle tattoo history on their bodies, and their dead are preserved as a record of what has happened. Knowing that they are a living part of history provides them extra resistance against fear, but they don&#039;t relate well with people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pack of the Blood Moon: Exceedingly loyal, each member of the Pack has an animal companion that it shares a spiritual link with...to the point that any powers they use extend to the animal as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Recoiling Serpents: They have an inherent, extreme amount of flexibility...but an extremely overdeveloped sense of vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Virtuous Body Gardeners: These guys broke off from The Living Chronicle and tattoo themselves heavily. However, they can use chi to manifest their tattoos in unique ways. In fact, they can incorporate minor objects into the tattoos! However, they stand out like sore thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Wardens of Equilibrium: Every Warden has a partner whose chi is opposite their own. They are obsessed with balance to the point that they will change sides in a conflict if it becomes unbalanced.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Will of Iron: These guys are obsessessed with justice, holding it above anything, even turning on allies who do wrong. Being metaphorically unyielding as metal, they can become attuned to metal (such as swords), and cannot be disarmed if they made the weapon themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ronin: Ronin can mix and match skills, powers and fighting styles, but lack the resources and power base of clan members.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My main comment on this section is that the comments from each representative clan member about the other clans was at first very jarring and very &quot;western&quot;...to the point that it almost bugged me. But as I&#039;m not a huge fan of the source material, it probably made it easier for me to accept it all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHARACTER BUILDING&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character building is point based, being very similar to Apocalypse Prevention, Inc. However, some bits are necessarily different.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You start by selecting your Concept, Passion, Element and Clan. Concept and Passion function largely as they do in API, while Element helps determine your starting Chi and Clan has a huge impact on you, as it dictates the Fighting Styles and Wushu (special powers) available to you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Passions either mirror the API passions or come close, but the Elements are a new bit. The chi users are tied to an element that holds sway over them, informing their actions, and when their chi is out of balance or depleted, the element influences them further. Earth-natured characters are heavily focused on balannce, Fire-balanced characters tend to be energetic leaders, Metal-balanced characters are firm, rigid and focused on justice, Water-focused are intelligent and cautious and Wood-natured are both kind and resilient. It also helps determmine your chi, which is used too power your wushu (Wu Xing&#039;s name for kewl powers).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chi comes in both Yin and Yang varieties, which can fuel wushu or provide a number of effects each, depending on the type of chi. You can also absorb too much chi, which can explode if not expelled fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The API stats of Power, Agility, Vigor, Intellect, Insight and Charm present here as well, with 30 points divided among them. All ninjas get a rank each in Legerdemain, Discipline, Stealth, Survival and their Primary Fighting Style before their 30 skill points kick in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Fighting Styles have charts full of modifiers...but also have special techniquest that the players can learn. Every style has an area that it is weak in and one that it is strong in, as well as a weapon that it favors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The styles are Bear (these guys can seriously take a hit, and can unleash frightening roars), Crane (they strike early and often, but for less overall damage), Crocodile (slower, stronger attacks), Dragon (skilled at fighting multiple opponents at once), Eagle (they try to keep their distance), Hawk (focused on striking very quickly), Horse (they try to outlast their opponents with pure stamina), Monkey (more unorthodox attacks), Snake (focusing on coiled, measured strikes), Tiger (heavy on damage, but not energy efficient) and Wildcat (heavy strikes, but a lot of openings).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ronin get 12 Bonus Points to spend on Gifts, everyone else gets 10. Many of the API Gifts and Drawbacks are here, but there are several new ones that are specific to Wu Xing, including determining your class.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A very handy reference guide is included, with a summary of all the steps in character creation and page number references for everything that didn&#039;t fit on the two pages. A sample character, built step by step, is included...complete with character sheet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WUSHU&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the Kewl Powerz chapter. Some powers can be powered by any kind of chi...some require either Yin or Yang specifically. A character&#039;s clan provides a bonus to the clan&#039;s favored Wushu, and the character&#039;s Element can provide bonuses or penalties in circumstances where other elements are involved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are ten general Wushu and ten clan specific Wushu. The general Wushus include The Ways of Beasts, Earth, Fire, Metal, Movement, Survival, the Unseen, the Warrior, Waterr and Wood. The Clan Specific Wushu are the Ways of Balanced Scales, Caring Hands, Ebony Clutches, Great Serpents, Heaven&#039;s Judgement, the Immaculate Show, Inked Skin, Kept Lore, Spun Threads and Twin Beasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every Way begins with minor effects which grow in power and effect. The Way of Beasts, for instance, begin with using Yang to enhance the ninjas eye sight and culminates in being able to transform into an animal. The Way of Fire can be used to cauterize a ninja&#039;s wounds and stop bleeding...or breathe fire. The Way of Metal can provide some very cool, Magneto-esque effects. The Way of Movement starts with running up walls, moves to running THROUGH walls and ends in teleportation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Wardens of Equilibrium can destroy chi, the Bamboo Herbalists can actually raise the dead, the Grasping Shadows can bind a target&#039;s shadow (semiparalyzing the target), Recoiling Serpents can shed their skin (healing surface injuries in the process), the Will of Iron can create diviine weapons of judgement that only harm their target (and harm them BADLY), the Blazing Dancers can learn an opponent&#039;s moves for a fight (including their Wushu if they sacrifice chi), the Virtuous Body Gardeners can draw weapons from their tattoos, the Living Chronicle can place the memories of themselves (or someone else) into a blank book, the Hidden Strands of Fate can manipulate their vocal cords to alter their voices and the Pack of the Blood Moon can atually merge their bodies with their canine companions!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That is just a sampling of the effects brought on by the Clan Specific Wushu. There are also guidelines for PCs altering Wushu, combining aspects of Wushu and even creating Wushu from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EQUIPMENT AND COMBAT&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wu Xing uses a very lite wealth system: You compare your Class ranking to the Cost of items, and if it is equal to, or better, and you could reasonably access the item, it&#039;s yours. Starting equipment is not limited to Class, but by character concept.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All of the weapons are given a brief description, as well as the armor. The armor of the Empire is bulletproof, which can be a nice surprise if a ninja takes away a gun and turns it on one of the Emperor&#039;s warriors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wu Xing uses the same combat system as API, implementing the Counts system, where characters can take multiple actions per round based off of the speed of their attacks. If you like combat with a lot of options, the Wu Xing system is going to be right up your alley. It provides a ton of choices, without a huge amount of crunch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most major (and minor) situations are covered by the rules, including some loose guidelines for combat in unusual situations such as fighting on rooftops or even treetops.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Making traps is also covered in this chapter, as ninja sure do like to use traps. They can even use chi powered traps, and guidelines are given for the different types of traps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The chapter ends with a combat sample that runs through the paces, showing combat tracking system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The combat system is crunchy in the sense that it provides a ton of options, though tracking Health, Stamina and Chi might get to be a bit much for some people. Personally, I think it just pushes the border, with the payoff exceeding the work, especially in small scale combats (1 on 1 or other small conflicts).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ANTAGONISTS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This chapter covers the important, useful stat blocks in the game, starting with animals. Townsfolk, town guards and local vigilantes are up next. The Empire&#039;s soldiers, engineers, Golden Lions and executioners are included. Various ninja stat blocks are provided, and then the book veers into spirit animals...celestial animals, both lesser and greater, that the ninja can bond with, as well as oni - big, bad demons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My primary complaint with this chapter is that it could use a bit more description regarding oni. A single &quot;average&quot; oni is present, but a few more examples would have been preferable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
STORYTELLING&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is, essentially, the GMing chapter. It encourages you to make sure that you are making the players the centerpiece of the story, and provides a list of the anime inspirations. I&#039;ve heard of several of the anime, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen any of them, except in passing. There are several campaign types provided, with plot hooks to work off of.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book ends with several reference pieces, starting with a glossary, then an index, the Fighting Style charts, a single page character sheet, blank combat tracker and three page character sheet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#039;t really like anime. I don&#039;t really like martial arts movies. There should be no compelling reason for me to enjoy the game...and yet, it is just FILLED with &quot;cool&quot;. The setting should be incredibly one note, with Ninjas vs Empire, but there is still a ton of room to play around with. The world is large, with plenty of room open for you to detail it yourself. Several mysteries are set up, but are meant to be answered by GMs as their campaigns dictate, not to be filled in by future supplements, an approach similar to that of Apocalypse Prevention, Inc...there is no metaplot dictating the direction of the Ninja Crusade, which I consider a plus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are some issues, however. The editing was a bit suspect on this one, with notable issues in the first chapter (especially with homonyms, such as the &quot;Forth Ninja War&quot;). More examples for oni could have been great as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book is in black and white, but as manga is typically in black and white, I don&#039;t consider that a style issue, and virtually every page is two columns of text, so the 221 pages are FILLED. With two RPGs produced so far, Third Eye Games has rapidly moved into my top tier of favored publishers this year and Eloy Lasanta seems to have a knack for creating settings that I just want to dive into and play in that is matched, to me, only by the Pinnacle crew.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have reviewed a lot of games this year, and I would be hard pressed to find one I recommend more than Wu Xing. I can&#039;t WAIT to see more, from Wu Xing and from Third Eye Games in general.</content>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82674&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;ION Guard ICONS Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a sourcebook for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=81475&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;ICONS RPG&lt;/a&gt; put forth by Colin Chapman and Radioactive Ape Designs and covering a section of the supers genre that never seems to get enough support: The cosmic hero subgenre.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Drawing from the obvious inspiration of DC&#039;s Green Lantern Corp (and perhaps Marvel&#039;s Nova Corp, which I prefer), ION Guard is a 59 page PDF running $7.99 at RPGnow. It is fully searchable with copy and paste enabled, as well as featuring clickable bookmarks, so it hits all of my important PDF features. A standard, detailed, table of contents is provided as well, which is always useful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THE ION GUARD MANUAL&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our first stop in the book is the ION Guard Manual, which is a two page overview of the ION Guard, including the meaning of ION (Intergalactic Ordinance Network). It gives an overview of their role as cosmic policemen, explains the significance of their symbol and talks about the creation of the ION Guard, when the last of the Ancients constructed an artificial world around a singularity and then installed himself into the construct, becoming ION Prime, in what reminds me a bit of Oa and the Xandarian Worldmind. ION Prime created the ION Fists and blasted them into the universe, where they sought out those who have what it takes to wield the ION Fists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
HISTORY&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though the ION Guard has existed for one billion years, the timeline only hits key points from within the last hundred years, such as the emergence of the Sinister Sorcerers of Skathros, Galactus eating Oa (well, it was Infinitus eating Ao, but yeah), the fall, disappearance and reemergence of Manis, an ION Guard gone rogue and now calling himself Maniacus and more. Wisely, the timeline is left wide open, especially later than 75 years or so, in order to give GMs extra flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
OBJECTIVES&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book tells us that there are many laws to the ION Guard, but three core tenets: Protect The Innocent, Apprehend Wrongdoers and Aid The Cause of Peace. There is the caveat that ION Guardsmen sometimes fly under the proverbial radar to get criminals when they are out of their jurisdiction, and a second caveat that, yeah, this is awful vague stuff...just like it is in the source material.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ORGANIZATION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ION Guard begins with ION Prime. From there, five Guardsmen are selected as The High Guard. There are 50 Guard Commanders and then individual Guardsmen. The book gives the five current High Guard, as well as their areas of expertise. As well, there are 10,000 Guardsmen spread out over 5,000 sectors...meaning there&#039;s not a huge density of Guardsmen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
RECRUITMENT&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Essentially, there are two methods of recruitment: You volunteer, at which pointed you are tested and interviewed extensively, and if the High Guard and ION Prime agree to it, you are inducted into the ION Guard, given an ION Fist and begin your training. The other way is when an ION Guardsman falls and the ION Fist detaches from its former owner and seeks out a new Guardsman...if they accept, then that&#039;s that, whether the High Guard cares much for it or not.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
TRAINING&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ION Guard training is designed to winnow out the weak, so that the Guard is as good and as efficient as it can be...only 10% of those who make it TO the training make it THROUGH the training. After a year of field training with a veteran, then they take The Oath, which makes them a full member:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“With Golden Light&lt;br /&gt;
I Fight For Right&lt;br /&gt;
Bear ION Fist&lt;br /&gt;
Against The Night&lt;br /&gt;
This I Swear&lt;br /&gt;
With Spirit Hard&lt;br /&gt;
Let Evil Fear&lt;br /&gt;
The ION Guard”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ION PRIME&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This chapter details the planet itself, with all its features, such as the Training Academy (complete with Training Robots), the Forcells and their Sentries, plus the Hall of Light, which honors the fallen. A sidebar is present discussing The Cosmic Singularity, and providing options for just what it actually is, as well as what exposure to it actually does, as the book ultimately leaves this up to the GM.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
RESOURCES&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Really, this chapter is about the ION Fists, also known as the Golden Gauntlets. The ION Fist channels the power of the Cosmic Singularity, and adjusts itself to fit the hero. The ION Fist absolutely resists removal, generally requiring that massive damage be done to the bearer first...and even then it should be a huge deal. Every ION Fist has a handful of powers that it gives, including Flight, Blast, Life Support and Uniform Creation...however, a section is provided for stunt ideas, such as using the ION Fist in unconventional ways. Also, the ION Fist is vulnerable to Magic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CREATING AN ION GUARD&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The one thing I don&#039;t like about the book is also one I&#039;m not sure how to fix. It specifically demands point based creation and, frankly, the thing I like most about ICONS is the random creation...but doing random creation with the ION Fist and without heavy houseruling is...difficult.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One interesting change is that the ICONS core rules seems to eschew the Origin system if you&#039;re using point buy...but ION Guard specifically uses Origins with the point buy...with everyone having the Unearthly option that combines two origins (Gimmick and one other Origin), complete with applying the modifiers after spending points. You get 30 points and you must have a minimum Awareness 6 (before modifiers), Intellect 3 and Willpower 4. You get the ION Fist, whose powers are set at Rank 8. Common Qualities and Challenges are presented as well, to help ensure that the characters “fit” the ION Guard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ADVENTURE SEEDS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A selection of mini adventure ideas, such as missing planets, world devastating storms and some tips on taking standard supers adventures and making them “cosmic”.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHARACTERS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three sample Guardsmen are provided: Caine Carston, Maug and Tamari. The best part of this chapter, however, is the sidebar in mixing the ION Guard with other, non-ION Guard supers...after all, Nova and (especially) The Green Lantern team up with Earth heroes all the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also get the fallen Guardsman Maniacus, who is kinda like Sinestro without any redeeming qualities. The Sinister Sorcerers of Skathros are statted up here, and are a whole order designed to provide opposition. Infinitus and his thralls are here as well, with Infinitus not given stats, and his four thralls (Asterox, Komett, Nebulea and Starr) taking some cues from Galactus&#039; Heralds and their focus on the elements, without just being rip-offs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, the book rounds out with some samples cosmic vehicles, the gravcar, gravtank and starfighters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A Sketch Gallery, Open Game Content notice and a single teaser for ALIEN EMPIRES caps the book off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONCLUSIONS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Honestly, this book almost singlehandedly takes ICONS from “looks cool” to “must play”. Removing ads, table of contents, sketches and full page art pieces and there&#039;s maybe 50 pages of content in this book...but MAN are they packed with good stuff. The Author draws VERY clear inspiration from Marvel and DC&#039;s cosmic titles, and manages it in such a way as to make it feel very much like an homage and not a rip-off. Combine that with just how underserved the cosmic supers genre is, and ION GUARD is practically a must-buy product.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The art, provided by Jess Jennings, is in an “animated” style like the ICONS corebook, but cleaner and tighter pretty much across the board, so it feels like it fits the game while also improving on the standards set. Similar things could be said about the writing. ICONS is maddeningly vague in places, while ION GUARD really does provide just enough detail to get you playing, but leaving the big things open for you to do with as you will.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My one complaint is not being sure how to reconcile random generation with the ION Fists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book has not only sold me on giving ICONS a go in play, but it also sold me on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82133&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;BASH version&lt;/a&gt; as soon as I&#039;m able to acquire it (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=65882&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;BASH&lt;/a&gt; is a bit higher on my “must-play” scale than ICONS is). A third party supplement that is basically a step up on the parent game in just about every way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just a great product all around.</content>

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/THbaSs6r_8I/AAAAAAAAAHQ/8n-rrEQA2HE/s1600/APIEurope.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/THbaSs6r_8I/AAAAAAAAAHQ/8n-rrEQA2HE/s320/APIEurope.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Okay, my streak ends at two. I admit it, I don&#039;t know what the cover of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=78502&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;API Worldwide: Europe&lt;/a&gt; is. Not that it&#039;s, like, indecipherable or anything...I just don&#039;t recognize it. Is it the European Union flag? I am a flag-waving, jingoistic American...I can&#039;t be expected to know this stuff. (Editor&#039;s note: Apparently it is the EU Flag. Yes, I should have known that already, but at least common sense mostly worked that out for me.)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Europe is about 90 pages and the PDF does have one strike against it: No bookmarks. Sorry, I need bookmarks anyway. I like to be able to pull &#039;em up and click around as I see fit. It is searchable and includes an index, but bookmarks would have been great.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We get a five page fiction piece that actually ties in with the adventure included in the book. Its not bad, really, as it serves to show the difference in the temperament between API US Agents and API UK Agents.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter one begins with a brief and almost apologetic overview, noting that there is just a ton of diversity to cover in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A Cliff&#039;s Notes version of the European Union is presented, along with a sidebar on how the fall of the Iron Curtain has affected API operations in Europe, and how the London and Moscow offices are increasingly at odds.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The overview of London provides a pair of plot seeds: A cyborg serial killer known as Red Jack, as well as a Spectral claiming to be Shakespearean actor John Gielgud...who has drawn a crowd of other Spectrals, as well as Spirit Eaters.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Big Ben is a giant antenna for magical energy, while Merlin&#039;s Eye, the giant ferris wheel, is a mass hypnosis device!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In fact, all the little “zoom ins” on London have at least one plot hook that could be expanded into a full blown adventure or two with a little work.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Zooming out into England outside of London, we get towns sacrificing virgins for power and longevity, ghouls that feed on fear and more. Other fun nuggets include a peaceful demon uprising in Wales seeking to limit API&#039;s control.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As the chapter looks to the rest of Europe, again it takes a slightly apologetic approach, because there is just So Much. Grendel, apparently, is alive...or at least something big and scary that the Danes believe is Grendel. Four Taylari singers called the Bridez of Dracula are secretly using their music to call out to the dread lord Dracula, in hopes of bringing him back...assuming he was ever real at all.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Honestly, for the first time, I feel like the line stumbles a bit. There is clearly a sense that they are trying to cover too much ground here, leaving it all feeling a bit flat.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter two delves into the European branch of API and their operations. The API was forged in Europe, doing battle with the Rat Queen, who unleashed the Black Plague.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Two other power groups exist in England, and have very different outlooks on API: The Knights of Solomon consider them upstarts who should not have interfered against The Rat Queen, while API and the Rosicrucians have had a pretty open exchange with one another.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Great Fire of London was an attack on API by The Knights of Solomon, which devastated the Taylari, but ultimately allowed API to rebuild bigger and better. Later, while API London&#039;s leader (at the time) Damon Nesbitt was out of the area, Fauns converged on London and started a panic. Trying to calm the people, they used their music...invoking a wave of orgies. Nesbitt cut a deal with the Chiron (centaurs), who mass poisoned the Fauns to end the problem. Nesbitt was removed from power, sparking a rivalry with his replacement, his brother Brennan. This ultimately ended in Damon&#039;s death.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We also get a sidebar here like we did in the Canada book, showing some of the techniques specially used by the Elites in Europe...my favorite being Ghost Hands, which allows them to affect Spectrals and the like with their bare hands.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We also begin to learn about the importance of Oaths, and Oathkeepers. Oaths are apparently a Really Big Deal, and it is the responsibility of the London Branch to watch them make sure API doesn&#039;t go around accidentally breaking them.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The London HQ itself is actually divided up into a network of places beneath London, with my favorite bits being that King Arthur&#039;s Round Table is still being put to use by current Director Jonathan Nesbitt, and the Trove: A vault of magical goodies.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Next up, we get to learn about how the various demon races interact with API Europe: Burners are second class citizens, Carriers have a pact with the Nesbitt family, the Company deals somewhat reluctantly with Chirons (who are not Nice Guys), Ondine have pacts with API London, which is causing problems when Lochs attack Ondines as it puts the London office in a tricky political position, and Spectrals from throughout Europe&#039;s history hang around, playing a role.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Finally, we get profiles on important staff in the London office.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter three gets into some of the other organizations in the area, beginning with the Rosicrucians. The Rosicrucians are staunch allies of API, teaching them magic in exchange for combat training, and both sides joining forces to face off the impending Apocalypse. The two sides are such allies, in fact, that API cells ofter call on Rosicrucians for assistance on missions.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Inner Circle are a bunch of corrupt politicians that are making deals with demons and circumventing API...but have something FAR more sinister than even that going on.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Knights of Solomon are dangerous foes who could easily have been allies of API...except for the whole “demon” issue. API thinks some are okay, the Knights do not. The Drawbacks almost make playing one of these too difficulty (you have to make a check to avoid flying into a rage if you even encounter someone who is friendly with demons), but they make a very cool addition to the world. Impressively, they even have the Holy Grail among their resources. Seriously, the Knights of Solomon are one of the coolest additions to the game, by fair.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The 7 Keys are the descendants of seven British soldiers who (kind of) fell under the sway of a powerful demon in World War II. I say “kind of” because the demon is imprisoned and needs the “7 Keys” to set it free...however, the families have instead used the demon&#039;s imprisoned state to leech off of it. The book only provides five of the Keys, giving you free reign to decide the other two as you will.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Greyfire Club are adventurers and artifact seekers who will do whatever it takes to acquire their targets...destroying half of the rain forest, murdering relatives, killing villages, you name it. To make it worse, often times their efforts wind up allowing demons a foothold into the world or allow artifacts to fall into the hands of those that should not have them.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter four gets into the new crunch, starting with the Path of Oaths, where we learn about the power in Oaths. Oaths require two willing participants, and Oath magic used to be used in marriage ceremonies, although nowadays, they don&#039;t bother. There are three “levels” of Oaths: Lesser, Greater and Legendary, with examples of both duties and punishments. And Oaths really are big deals, as magic backs up the pact, meaning it backs up the punishment if someone breaks the oath.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Path of Fortune also gets a few spells added to it, including a spell that allows a caster to take his own life to save another. Nice flavor, but I don&#039;t see that one getting used a ton.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
New equipment gets added here, including the “required by the London office” Demon Scanners and the pretty awesome Black-Flame Thrower that is designed to only hurt demons and leave everyone and everything else be.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Then we get to some awesomeness: artifacts! Caliburn leads off the list, and all artifacts have both cool bonuses and heinous drawbacks.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
New Antagonists include Basilisks, The Furies, Pegasi, Unicorns and the Sphinx, as well as antagonist stat blocks for the new races in this book.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Speaking of: Chiron, Fauns, Hidden Folk and Morgane are the new races added in API: Europe.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chiron are centaurs, and are vicious, nasty creatures that API has a grudging pact with.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Fauns are also known as Satyrs, and are essentially under the rules of Chirons, whether they like it or not.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hidden Folk are elves, but are really spirits who hop from body to body. Initially, they look just like their host, but over time the body begins to transform into more traditional elven characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Morgane are virtually immortal, mysterious manipulators. Merlin, in fact, is a Morgane. In their normal form, they have sunken, black holes for eyes and featureless faces and they must consume human souls to remain on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Included in the book is an adventure called “Elsewhere?” that picks up with the agents from the prologue, as well as Big Ben, being sucked away into another dimension. The disappearance of Big Ben is being covered up by magical veils, preventing a giant panic.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The trip into The Wastes allows for fun with giants that utterly dwarf humans, as well as creepy ice spiders native to the dimension. The fate of Big Ben, the agents and the 500 ft radius around Big Ben is revealed...with a little twist. In the end, the Agents have the opportunity to put down a giant demonic prince as well as establish diplomatic relations with giants...so long as they don&#039;t get stranded in the Wastes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A London branch specific debriefing form is provided, followed by an index. One other small change from the previous books, though, is that the last few pages are filled with advertising, a noticeable amount more than was present in the previous books.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In the final analysis? I like it...with a “but”. There&#039;s some really good stuff here (I love the Knights of Solomon, The Morgane, the artifacts and the Path of Oaths). The adventure is another great example of what you can do with API that isn&#039;t quite like any other adventure released for it so far. I also love that things like the Ondine were not ignored, even though they appeared in another book. They didn&#039;t shoehorn, say, Wendigo in just because...but if they fit in, like Ondine? Absolutely use them in the text, building on what came before. Also, I love a lot of the plot seeds dropped around to be expanded on (from the big, obvious ones like the 7 Keys to John Gielgud drawing his crowd of ghosts)...but whereas API: Canada managed to make the Great White North feel like it was bursting with adventure potential, API: Europe tried to cover too much for its page count, and that made Europe feel a little...lacking. Honestly, I think I would have preferred &lt;i&gt;API: London&lt;/i&gt;, with a slightly less detailed look at the rest of the UK, rather than also trying to cover France, Romania, Italy, Greece and so on.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There were a few other niggling issues worth noting, the first being at least a couple of instances of “see page XX” popping up in the text, placeholder page markers that never got filled in. It is also worth noting that we get introduced to our third straight beast that is a mass of tentacles and teeth (Grendel, like The Thing Under The Ice and The Vastness before it), although “Grendel” is left vague enough that it could just be a manifestation of The Thing Under The Ice&#039;s global reach mentioned in Canada.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It&#039;s still a very good book with some great ideas (I LOVE the Morgane, *really* like the Chiron and Hidden Folk, and like the Fauns), just next to Canada it kind of stumbles, unfortunately.</content>

The first (and thus far, only) release in the Demon Codex series for Apocalypse Prevention Inc. is Lochs, detailing the fishy race found in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=59016&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;API corebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
One minor strike against &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=61485&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Demon Codex: Lochs&lt;/a&gt; right off is that the cover art is recycled from the interior of the API corebook...the Loch wearing surfer&#039;s shorts. Otherwise Lochs, in PDF form for $9.99, is a fully searchable, indexed, bookmarked digital tome clocking in at 85 pages. Obviously, its all about the Lochs...but is it worth buying, especially if you&#039;re not a big fan of them? Let&#039;s take a look...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The book opens with a piece of short fiction introducing Jonah, a Loch who serves as a quasi-narrator/POV character in the book.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Lochs are a fish-like demon species who have been cursed with the Contagion, which makes them unable to breed normally. However, on earth they have discovered that they can implant eggs into humans...though only women have successfully given birth to the new Half-Lochs. Men...not so much.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Anyway, that&#039;s the basic background.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Codex begins with the history of the Sedrone, more or less what the Lochs were called before they came to Earth. To sum it up, they were a savage, conquering race who took what they wanted and killed all that opposed them...until a rebel faction plagued them with the Contagion, which killed 90% of the Sedrone and left them unable to reproduce with one another! A number of Sedrone tried to escape the Contagion by fleeing to Earth in portals, but it was too late.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Voltics had answered a distress call by the rebels and came to aid them against the Sedrone...but they arrived after the Contagion had ended the war, and so they pretty much enslaved what was left. API has crossed paths with the Voltics a few times since, and it hasn&#039;t been pretty.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter one provides a lot of detail on Domainya, the watery dimension that was home to the Sedrone...literally a dimension entirely underwater...lit by glowing plants on the ground and no overheard source of light, as it all just fades into the Dark Horizon once you get too far removed from the floor.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In the present day, API has a contingent present in Domainya, helping aid the fight against the Voltics in the presumed interest of turning the Spandrels (which was the cradle of the Sedrone empire) back over to the Sedrone. The human in charge of the operations has developed a growing fondness for the Rebels, while API&#039;s official stance backs the Lochs/Sedrone. This chapter sets the conflict up nicely, then lays out three “this might happen” scenarios for the conclusion of the conflict.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There are a number of cool little layers in this war, such as API recruiting the Ondine (an Earth-based aquatic race) for help, who are motivated entirely by the idea that if they help the Lochs, the Lochs will leave the Earth and essentially stop challenging their supremacy of the seas. Also, one of the Rebel races, the Scryers, is planning a second Contagion, this time aimed at the Voltics. Chapter one basically lays out what could be a whole campaign on its own, completely aside from anything else presented thus far in the API line.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter two details the exodus to Earth. It started off as an invasion, as the Sedrone mustered up a massive army of 500,000 soldiers...then promptly went a different route once they realized how bad they were screwed numbers wise.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Their first portal transport to Earth was in a little body of water called Loch Ness, where they encountered API agents...and thus, they became known as Lochs.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Lochs arrived en masse in Brazil, and wound up in open conflict with API, which they lost. They were quarantined and then registered, with a large number of Lochs embracing human culture and even The Company. However, there are still more than a few “anti-human” holdouts.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As extinction, due to The Contagion, loomed over the Lochs they grew desperate. Given their dominating and violent nature, some Lochs engaged in rapes of humans and discovered...that they could breed together. The Lochs have since learned that every attempt to breed, though the child may survive, results in the death of a parent. So now the Lochs and humans are exhausting every procreational method they can to try to save Lochs from extinction. Half-Lochs are being born, and the oldest right now is about four years old...so they may yet save the Lochs from extinction.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The human friendly Lochs have utterly embraced human culture, from movies to popular music and so on. They stole hold out some traditions for themselves, but by and large, they had tried to integrate as much as they can on Earth. This isn&#039;t universal, of course, as a number of other immigrants still hold tightly to their culture and frown on Loch integration...these immigrants also still use “Sedrone” as their identifier and not “Lochs”.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We get a little sidebar here by Jonah, from the beginning fiction, talking about the other demons and how Lochs view them overall...perhaps surprisingly, they like Burners the best and don&#039;t care much for...well..most anything else besides humans.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In another nice little touch, API has set up a series of underwater bases that they use Loch agents to man, in the Sea of Japan, Jamaica, the Mediterranean Sea, Antarctica, off the coast of India and in the Pacific Ocean. Each base serves a specific purpose and has their own internal quirks.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A community in the Florida panhandle, called Black Moss Lake, is also detailed...being the place where the API first brought the Lochs after quarantine ended. Its described as being a bit of a hodge podge of human and Loch architecture, but the Lochs who are there still consider it very much home.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Lochs and their relations with four other races are also provided, closing out the chapter: The Linx, which were a bit of a servant race back on Domainya, are split: Some still stick close to Lochs, others have begun to latch onto humans. A very rare few are becoming overtly independent. Ondine are not demons, but an aquatic race the developed on Earth and have had many a violent conflict with Lochs over the Earth&#039;s oceans, as they consider themselves the rules and Lochs as interlopers. Scryers, the race that infected Lochs with the Contagion, obviously have very strained relations (at best) with the Lochs. Finally, there are the Voltics. Much like the Tarks from the core rules, they hit Earth for specific missions...however, their portals also allow the great Kraken known as The Vastness to access Earth as well, making it DOUBLY bad for everyone involved.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Oh, and a final note is included on Lochs...apparently they LOVE cybernetic implants and, unlike Changelings, it doesn&#039;t limit their usefulness as agents.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter Three gets into Loch groups...helpfully noting that not all Lochs like humans and not all Lochs are on board with API.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Aquatic Alchemists are creepy. Aquatic alchemy is where the Contagion was spawned from, and it has been frowned upon ever since if killed 90% of the Lochs and sterilized everyone it didn&#039;t kill. Everything from herbs to animals to people can be used as ingredients...and they are. Currently, Alchemists are divided into two main groups now: Those striving to cure the Contagion and those who are striving to create a new Contagion...to be used on humans.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Deep Green isn&#039;t a Loch group exactly...its a plastics corporation who has inflicted damage to Lochs living in the ocean with their illegal dumping, and sparked a war with them over it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Forgotten Tribes are the Lochs that arrived in South America during the initial migration, and have become weakened over the years...the elder immigrants having largely died off now and the younger ones trying to make their way.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hooks were kind of like the CIA on Domainya, and now are pretty much bounty hunters and PIs. They welcome any law-abiding member of an aquatic race and are often used as sub-contractors by API, and as an alternate solution for demons that don&#039;t want to deal with API for matters.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Hope Foundation is a group dedicated to save the Lochs from extinction. It arranges two Lochs and a human, who attempts to carry the Half-Loch to term. Only two Half-Lochs have been born through the organization, and they have done some...spotty ethical things to get that far, using the salvation of the Lochs as their justification. They are a huge thorn for API, who would love to take them out, because they couldn&#039;t end the operation all at once, and a large number of Lochs look to The Hope Foundation for, well, hope.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Red Steps are somehow creepier than the Aquatic Alchemists, being Lochs who have taken over Michigan slaughterhouses and are now pumping various races through there, turning them into food that they are selling off to fast food places.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Yeah.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Superior City is an Ondine city in Lake Superior that Lochs overtook. Nestled in the heart of the city, much like Excalibur, is a trident that is trapped in a statue. Full stats are provided for the Trident, should you wish to insert it into your game.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter four gets more in depth into actually playing Lochs.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
First off, it provides three methods for Lochs to work among humans, from Image Emitters, to the Trenchcoat Rule to the very creepy alchemists who use human skin as a disguise.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A reminder is provided on the creepiness of Loch-human sexual relationships, which have involved rape more often than once in the past. Also, while Lochs make good fighters, the book provides tips on playing non-combat themed Lochs as well.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A new Passion, Redemption, is provided. New Gifts include Aquatic Alchemy as well as other physical modifications such as tentacles and crab claws, which have their own advantages.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A new Drawback, Water Breather, is provided for those who just don&#039;t breath well out of water.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
New equipment includes the H.I.C.C.U.P., an underwater transport, as well as M.U.E.s, which are special diving suits, and Compressor Cloth, which helps condense a large-framed individual who is using an image emitter.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
New cybernetic options are provided, such as Waterproofing, a Current Generator (torso mounted, creating strong currents) and Air Lungs, which allow the recipient to adapt between two environments, such as land and sea.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A list of Aquatic Alchemy items are included, like the Siren Choker, which gives a bonus to Perform Checks, Aqua Lung (gives a land lubber the ability to breath in the water), the Infinite Box (made from the pieces of a Husk) and Human Skin, which makes for the ultimate disguise.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
New Antagonists include The Afflicted (Scriers altered by the Contagion), Charcadons (scary, shark beasts), dolphins and sharks, krakens, The Vastness&#039; Tentacles and more.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The new races are given profiles like those in the corebook.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Linx are odd little guys...a single Linx is born into four bodies, which operate with one mind. They cannot willingly go more than 300 ft apart, and being forced apart is Very, Very Bad.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Ondine claim to be the children of Poseidon, and are essentially merpeople...and as they were The aquatic race on Earth for thousands of years, they don&#039;t like Lochs at all.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Scriers are the guys that created the Contagion, and also have a second set of eyes, which allow them to see into the magical spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Voltics are war mongers who occasionally make in-roads into Earth and are considered very much illegal by API.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Finally, for those who want to run the timeline ahead or play around with the setting in other ways, rules for playing grown Half-Lochs are included, even though there aren&#039;t currently any older than the age of four, officially.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Two adventures are included as well, the first being Deep Run in the Tunnels, which serves as a primer on Domainya. Reports are that a female Loch is apparently pregnant by another Loch, which could be huge news for the future of the Lochs. The Agents are sent after the missing Agent who reported this phenomena. The Agents get to experience some Domainya politics as well as possibly snatch up a Loch artifact.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Jaws Snapping In The Dark is a hunt involving a batch cloned Lochs gone bad. It is pretty much a straight forward investigation culminating in a big, bloody fight (most likely).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Honestly, the adventures are the weakest part of the book...but that might be because the book is just TEEMING with plot hooks, seeds and goodness. Seriously, even ignoring the adventures this is an amazing book. The information on Domainya is enough to run a whole campaign on, and then throw in all the great stuff with the factions, plus five new races.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Lochs are presented as complicated creatures...you can play them as fun-loving joke characters...giant fish wandering around in trenchcoats...or blood thirsty conquerors...or a fallen, tragic species driven to desperate measures in order to survive. Throw in the quirky Linx, the poor Scriers who are stuck in a bad place no matter what they do, and the Voltics as pretty much unambiguous bad guys, and this is just a great resources.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Some minor failings bring the book down just a hair, but this is by and large an amazing supplement that really sets the bar for future Demon Codices.</content>

I had no idea that Canada meant “Big Village”. Seriously. That&#039;s the first little tidbit I learned about Canada from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=60203&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;API Worldwide Canada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; region sourcebook for &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=59016&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Apocalypse Prevention Inc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Great White North gets a full treatment, complete with plot seeds, some new rules and a few new races.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/THOurvLbiQI/AAAAAAAAAHA/_NDtJ71ga5E/s1600/canada.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/THOurvLbiQI/AAAAAAAAAHA/_NDtJ71ga5E/s320/canada.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The 85 page PDF is fully searchable and bookmarked, again featuring a great index but only a mediocre table of contents. The book is in black and white, but the cover motif is similar to the corebook&#039;s, with the fiery backdrop to a skyline, and this time featuring a blood-splatter in the shape of the Canadian Mapleleaf.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We learn right up front that the API branch of Canada is spread awfully thin because Bad Stuff happens all over the country, but they just don&#039;t have the manpower be everywhere they need to be...so its less about “stopping bad stuff from happening” and more “hope too many people don&#039;t die before we get there”...which is kinda bleak, really.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Like the US in the corebook, Canada has further tightened their gun laws, leaving guns largely in the hands of hunters alone. Can&#039;t say as the gun stuff thrills me much. I&#039;m not a gun nut, but I am a pretty hardcore Libertarian type, and I tend to think that taking guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens tends to just leave them vulnerable to bad guys, but that&#039;s neither here nor there.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After the general overview of Canada, the book gets into deeper detail, starting with Montreal, hope of API&#039;s main Canadian HQ. Montreal sounds like a lovely place, where life moves at its own pace, from the laid back record store guy to the hyperactive would be executive. One of the first plot seeds are dropped here, a Spectral that haunts Montreal&#039;s wi-fi network and (apparently randomly) inserts and encrypts files on people&#039;s computers through the network. Another nice tidbit is about a gentleman who owns a carpet cleaning company, and encountered the ghost of a suicide victim while on a job...after peacefully convincing the Spectral to move on, he would up seeking out ghosts, and is now a sub-contractor for API.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Underneath Old Montreal lies the API HQ, protected with an anti-violence ward, not unlike Lorne&#039;s club Caritas from the TV show Angel.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Other useful tidbits include the sudden spike in crime in the region due to gang conflicts as well as mafia push, the higher than average Wolf Person population in the area, the Montreal Undercity (featuring a large population of Taylari, who became much more compliant after UV strobes were installed in the area), and more.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Though Montreal gets the prime focus, the book does cover Canada as a whole, and so it moves to the West Coast and Interior. The Rocky Mountains that run through British Columbia are a hotbed of supernatural activity, for instance, and Tarks have a heavy presence in Regina, Saskatchewan. Once you get in the Northern Territories, you can have all kinds of fun with tiny, tiny towns being stalked by a single demon or two. We also learn that the US branch “lets” the Canadian Branch of API protect Alaska, rather than keeping up their “two teams” approach up there. Hmmm...I wonder if they also think Hawaii is too much hassle, or if they&#039;re cool sending isolated teams out there?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Aurora Borealis gets special treatment here, as it is a pile of discarded Mana and, some believe, where many demonic souls go. It has in-game effects if a character is brought near death in the proximity of them, warping and transforming the weakened and often screwing with magic cast around them as well.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter two begins to get into the nitty gritty of the API in Canada. The current leader of API Canada, Gerard Robert, is descended from Guillot Robert, an exceedingly brilliant tactician who apparently planned the breeding of his descendants for maximum effect. Being an API Agent in Canada means working with fewer resources and less back-up than other places, especially places like America. Canada Agents are also taught to subdue and not kill unless necessary, a bit of a contrast with US Agents.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We get our first real game mechanics in a sidebar in this book, with four new Elite Training Techniques, including two fairly wicked ones in which the Agent controls their internal body temperature in order to inflict extra damage to creatures sensitive to heat or cold.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Due to the shortage in manpower, Agents in Canada are able to get away with breaking more rules without close scrutiny due to the unspoken reality that the Agency can&#039;t afford to crack down on rogue behavior. There is a bit of sibling rivalry on the Board of Directors, as Gerard Robert and his older brother Serge struggle...with Serge undercutting Gerard often, but Gerard seemingly not moving against him in retaliation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We also get a bigger look at The Thing Under The Ice, an entity that threatens Canada and feasts on still-beating human hearts, but that they just don&#039;t know that much about. The TUTI has a number of minions, including Possessors that kinda do what their name implies, and cults that have risen up to worship this thing...(as happen when Things Man Was Not Meant To Know make their presence felt).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Canadian HQ itself is well protected, in that they have eliminated almost all normal entrances, and use portals to achieve access instead. A sidebar details three of the inmates imprisoned in the HQ, one of whom was a sadistic, blood-drinking rapist who kept up his evil ways as a ghost as well as Patient Zero, who was the Canadian Branch&#039;s first attempt at harnessing the power of the Aurora Borealis. It didn&#039;t quite work.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A section is included on Demon Agents...as expected, Burners aren&#039;t terribly prevalent in the Canadian Branch. Two new races included in the book, Husks and Wendigos, are often used as agents...and while they will turn a blind eye to the Illegal status of some Carriers and Oracles, Gerard Robert tends to only use Spectrals for experimentation and not as Agents. There is also what amounts to a special ops squad known as The Radicals, which is currently five Demons (the numbers may change, but The Radicals are always Demons).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
An overview is provided of major NPCs in the Canadian branch and their uses in the game, including leader Gerard Robert, leader of the Canadian Elites Cassie Fredericks, Francois Chevalier – Wolf Person and illegitimate son of Gerard Robert, and Trask, a Changeling and leader of the Radicals.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter three touches on the other major power groups in Canada.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Alpha Pack is loosely knit network of Wolf People that has a pretty good working relationship with API. The Wolf People in Canada tend not to organize into large groups, but instead operating solo or in pairs, then surrounded by “normal” wolves. The Alpha Pack doesn&#039;t do harm to humans directly, though they will take the fight to those that would harm the environment or their wolf brethren. In addition, they wage war with The Thing Under The Ice, the Wendigo and more.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Thing Under The Ice is just creepy, as it is apparently located under the thickest ice in Canada, but its reach can wind up global in scope. It apparently sleeps for thousands of years until hunger stirs it...the begins to awaken, sending its minions out and feasting on the world at large. Did I mention that its reach has been global in the past? A whole cult is devoted to it, and they think it is part of the Earth&#039;s life cycle...the planet gets overpopulated, The Thing Under The Ice trims the population. Wash, rinse, repeat. Makes a certain kind of crazy sense. Stats are given for the TUTI&#039;s tentacles, pseudopods and maws, for it can be fought back...but bashing a tentacle tends to have little actual effect on the beast overall.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Ordo Cryos are a group of Adepts studying the Path of Ice for the purpose of combatting Global Warming. They have ran afoul of the TUTI&#039;s cult, as a deep freeze of Earth makes it harder for TUTI to feed, you see, and the cult can&#039;t have that. The Ordo Cryos come across mostly as flavor in the book, since they keep an incredibly low profile while studying magical cooling on a global level.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
LeyLines.Org is an organization devoted magically zipping around the wilderness, finding those who are lost and returning them to civilization. Gerard Robert, however, has begun to suspect that they use their powers for other purposes, such as trafficking of controlled substances...he just doesn&#039;t have proof...yet.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Two Thousand Sleepers are a Taylari group who are all about any region that is shrouded in night for months at a time. That, in and of itself, isn&#039;t a huge issue for API...but the Two Thousand Sleepers also tend to think that the feral, Taylari Mortus state is a holy state that needs to be revered.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter four is heavy on the rules content. Weather related stuff, like snowblindness, avalanches and frostbite are covered here, as are a couple of new combat rules. Tons of new equipment is present, including a laundry list of snow gear. For the heat sensitive, the Heat Wave is presented: A rifle designed to fire concentrated heat. Mirror Keys are emergency transport for API Agents, and Neural Gauntlets transmit electric feedback to anything that&#039;s hit with them. A couple of new cybernetics are listed here, such a crampons that extend from bionic feet for climbing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
New monsters are present as well, including Abominable Snowmen, the TUTI&#039;s Harvesters, Fenris Wolves and, my personal favorite, Freed Reflections. Mirror Magic can release a person&#039;s reflection, which is then obsessed with killing them...after that, it acts out the original&#039;s darkest desires.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Four new Paths are presented, the Paths of Ice, Mirrors, Shadows and Fractures (the latter of which is only performed by Husks).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The three new races are detailed: Husks, Wendigos and Infected. The Husks are creepy, statuesque creatures that don&#039;t eat or breath as normal and have one of the least human outlooks presented so far. In order to effectively move in combat, they must “crack their shell” and they can&#039;t heal until they “set the shell”.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Wendigos are ravenous meat eaters that make Wolf People look cultured and civilized. They look pale and frostbitten normally, and upon consuming at least five pounds of fresh meat, they transform into giant, ravenous beats. API has tried to “neuter” a few Wendigos and turn them into Agents, but they are always treated with suspicion and mistrust.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Infected look utterly normal, except that you can see the Northern Lights in their eyes. They are created when the TUTI&#039;s Slugs “impregnate” human females. From birth they manipulate those around them, forcing their parent(s) to feed them a diet of human hearts and extending their control from there as they get older. At the age of 30, they begin making their way to the TUTI...though to what end, exactly, is unclear.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Two adventures are provided in this book: Danger at the Mine and Splinter.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Danger at the Mine serves as a nice introduction to Canada. Two Agents and their guide have gone missing, and the PCs are called in to retrieve them. Along the way, they get introduced to Wendigo, The Infected, the Devotees of the Cull and a Possessor, plus exposure to the weather rules and cool gear from earlier in the book. The adventure is prevented fairly broadly...it&#039;s “rail-roady” in the sense that you are Agents with orders, but other than that, there is very little “You Must Do This” in the adventure. Different situations have different potential outcomes that will, in turn, have different consequences depending on what you do. I think it could be a swell campaign launching point, or you could use it with American Agents “on loan” due to manpower shortages as a change of pace.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Splinter is...kinda trippy. It involved a Husk serial killer who has found a superthin crack in reality. Without giving too much away here...don&#039;t run it with less than four people...UNLESS you want to run it with two players and add some NPCs...as the adventure requires splitting the party (I know, right? But it all kinda works out, really).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Danger at the Mine, as written, is the stronger adventure...but Splinter, if pulled off well, is rather cool.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I tend to dismiss game fiction, but there is a prologue with a Canadian Agent suffering a broken leg, as well as an epilogue featuring Gerard Robert pressing him back into action with a replacement leg for his own, unknowable purposes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Finally, a cute little API “Field Report” form is given, that can be filled out as a record for missions if one likes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I gotta say...Third Eye Games makes the frozen North seem awfully cool. You have Wendigos running around, The TUTI and God only knows what its up to, Adepts trying to freeze the world to save it...all cool stuff, none of which is directly tied into the core book, thus making the API World seem even bigger and more active. Hopefully this is only setting the stage for more awesome Region books.</content>

                    <content type="html">
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/THI1m8DbmmI/AAAAAAAAAGw/e4FL9NBvGUM/s1600/API.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/THI1m8DbmmI/AAAAAAAAAGw/e4FL9NBvGUM/s320/API.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=59016&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Apocalypse Prevention Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a cool game that was offered up as part of the awesome Haiti Bundle on DriveThruRPG earlier this year, and as cool as it looked, I got more than a tad overwhelmed with EVERYTHING that came in the bundle. However, API has caught my attention all over again, because Third Eye Games just announced at GenCon that API will be coming to Savage Worlds as a Savage Setting! That tickles me pink, I&#039;ll be honest...&#039;cause I loves me some Savage Worlds. This review, however, is for the first edition of the game, using Third Eye Games&#039; Dynamic Gaming System.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cover is a striking black and orange, with the silhouette of a city skyline up top and what appears to be flames behind it. On the center of the page is a blood splatter in the shape of the continents. The PDF itself is fully bookmarked and searchable, and is available for $12.95 at RPGnow. Additionally, a print version is available for $24.95.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Written by Eloy Lasanta, API is an action-horror RPG with a bit of a comedy twist...or, as I&#039;ve heard it mentioned before, it&#039;s “Joss Whedon&#039;s Men in Black”. The book begins with a brief overview of the setting, which is about a shadow corporation protecting the world from all the ooky demons that might threaten it, and touching briefly on just what those demons are (many of which are playable races in the game). As well, it gives a brief paragraph about the core mechanic of the system, which is d20+attribute+skill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A “What Is Roleplaying” section follows, but it keeps it brief. Not bad, but nothing you haven&#039;t read before, and I appreciate the brevity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, an in-character memo is posted, welcoming the “New Agent” to Apocalypse Prevention Inc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The table of contents is a bit broad, listing just the chapter headings...but since there is a full index (as well as bookmarks in the PDF), this isn&#039;t a huge strike. Even in the hardcopy version I would forgive it because of the index.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character Creation is up first, and broken down into five steps, the first of which is Concept, Passion and Race.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Concept is pretty broad, but should be distilled to a couple of words or so. Passion is picked from a list, each of which has a situation in which the PC can earn bonus XP, such as Honor providing XP whenever the PC abides by their code even in the face of negative consequences, Rivalry giving a bonus when you get a leg up over your rival, or Death providing bonus XP whenever you survive a near death experience. As well, a helpful sidebar is provided, giving examples of how different Passions can alter the same Concept. Finally, you select your race: Human, Burners (fire demons), Changelings (shape shifting demons), Lochs (giant fish demons), Spectrals (ghosts who failed to move on), Taylari (living vampires) and Wolf People (kinda like werewolves). As well, there are three “illegal” races provided, Carriors (disease eating demons), Oracles (demons who can see the future) and Tarks (massive demonic hulks). The illegals are held to the back of the book, but are playable with GM permission.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For concept, I&#039;m going with “Boring Pencil Pusher”. Passion? Revenge. Race: Spectral. Bart Angleman was an API file clerk who had fallen in love with Alyssa, a lovely changeling of indeterminate age. They cohabitated for a few years, though Alyssa never really returned Bart&#039;s feelings, but privately told those she spoke with that “he loves me enough for the both of us”. Bart, for his part, subconsciously understood that Alyssa needed more than him, and rarely questioned her comings and goings. He returned home from the office to find their apartment wrecked, and Alyssa dying on the floor. Angleman never realized that the trio of hunters that had tracked her down and attacked her were still there, and murdered him, assuming him to be a Changeling as well. He was not...he was just a heartbroken schlub who refused to let go of the mortal coil...now, he walks the earth as a Spectral Agent of API, specializing in shutting down monster hunters who would kill otherwise harmless, friendly demons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, we spend 30 points on our attributes, which are Power, Agility, Vigor, Intellect, Insight and Charm. These are ranked from 1-10, with 9-10 costing 2 points per level instead of one. Being a pencil pusher, we&#039;re going to go a little heavier on the mental than physical attributes, I think.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
POW: 3 AGI: 2 VIG: 4 IQ: 9 INS: 7 CHM: 4&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There we go...I think that&#039;ll work nicely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Step 3: Distribute 30 skill points, plus an additional point for every level of IQ. There are 20 standard skills, plus 12 combat skills, as well as a list of Spectral Skills, which is what Bart will need in order to actually affect the outside world. At different thresholds (4, 7 and 10), the PC gets a Specialty for the skill (when available) as well, something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Affect Senses (Repetitive Typing Sounds) 4, Computers 5, Float 4, Knowledge (Bureaucracy, Demonology) 8, Manifestation 8, Possess Object (computers) 5, Stir (Typing) 5.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There we go: His main marketable skills from API are represented, and he&#039;s quickly become a fast study on the ghost stuff. Good times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unless I am horrible mistaken, Bart gets Appearance (Fear 13), plus Ghost Form and the Drawback Sealed Inner Circles for being a Spectral. This essentially means he&#039;s kinda creepy, and can&#039;t affect anything (or even be seen, other than giving people a cold chill) without the skills he took above, and he can&#039;t use much in the way of magic. He also gets a further 10 points to spend on Gifts (or Attributes and Skills if he chooses), but he can also take up to 10 points in Drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perfect Memory (3) seems like a good one for Bart. Let&#039;s take Punctual (1) as well. Years inside a cubicle has given him Iron Will (4), and he has amassed a huge Library (4). Now he needs at least 2 points of Drawbacks...I&#039;m thinking Speech Impediment. Howabout...Stuttering?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now derived stats: Using the formulas in the book we get Health of 22, Initiative of 9, Stamina 33, Walking is 5 ft and running speed is 100 yards per minute. Jumping is only 3 ft horizontally, and he can&#039;t swim...poor guy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not bad, not bad. The concept may have been kinda grim for setting, but I could see it working. Especially with lots of “Office Space” humor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s worth noting that there is a lot more depth in the skill system getting into the combat skills, I just ventured entirely into a non-combat character here. The six attributes are pretty much the d20 Ability Scores renamed, while a lot of the character generation reminds me of White Wolf&#039;s character creation standards. Definitely not a rip-off of either, but I do see what appears to be influence, especially from White Wolf. In fact, much like White Wolf&#039;s books, API provides a character generation summary nestled into the first couple of pages of the section, where it gives an overview of Concept and spells out the Passions and their rewards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From there, each of the legal Races get a profile, including common nicknames for the race (such as Humans being called Baselines or Spectrals being known as Caspers), as well as common stereotypes (Burners are hot-headed, Lochs are wise). Each section, about two pages or so on average, gives the story of the species, their common lifestyles, how they are commonly recruited into API (Changelings make great spies), any starting Gifts or Drawbacks a well as unique ones available for each race to purchase. Finally, each race has a picture included, as well as a sample NPC representative of the race, complete with a hook for using them in your game. There are some nice quirks here: Taylari drink blood, are allergic to garlic and dislike sunlight, but are otherwise living and breathing beings. However, if they die, they become feral Taylari Mortus. Lochs are a fallen noble race who mate with humans when they can in order to propagate their species...but humans die in childbirth with a Loch child.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Attributes section is well laid out, listing each of the six attributes, with relevant tables and formulas immediately underneath each Attribute (such as the formula for holding one&#039;s breath under Vigor).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skills have a very basic formula for difficulties: 10 is the base difficulty, and each level of complexity one tries to achieve is ten points higher, with a 40 being near impossible...(as it would require having a 10 in the Attribute, 10 in the relevant Skill and rolling a 20, or an 18 with a relevant specialty). Untrained Skill Checks don&#039;t have penalties, they are just Attribute-only checks. Natural 20s are an automatic success, Natural 1s an automatic failure. Specialties provide an additional +2 on a roll. It&#039;s a straightforward system, laid out very clearly. Each skill listing provides common specialties, as well as examples as to just what each benchmark may entail, like a Moderate (20) Discipline check helping you keep your cool in a gunfight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Combat Skills are a little different, as only Fighting Style: Basic can be purchased through normal skill points alone...each of the trained styles require a a Gift to unlock them. Each style has a table showing your bonuses at each level, and you gain a Technique at levels 4, 7 and 10, ala Skill Specialties. Probably my biggest gripe here is the combat Technique “Close Line”. As a pro wrestler, I HAVE to point out that it should be “clothesline”. Other than that, the Combat Skills provide a fairly crunchy system without being overwhelming, reminiscent somewhat of the old Palladium Martial Arts system, in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gifts and Drawbacks are explained in detail, though a handy reference with point totals is provided at the beginning of this section. There&#039;s very likely room for expansion, but there&#039;s still a good number of Gifts and Drawbacks provided here. Access to Magic is bought through here, as well as quirky Gifts like Dumpster Stomach, which allow the PC to eat pretty much whatever he wants with no issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Equipment acquisition is handled through the Wealth Gift, which ranges from 0 to 5. Every item has a Cost score, and you simply compare your Wealth to the Cost to see if you can purchase it...and yes, people can combine Wealth for more expensive items.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the items listed are fairly normal: Nightvision goggles, first-aid kit, gas mask...but there are also faerie guns, which fire a foam that kills faeries (and also rats), image emitters (which Lochs often use to get humans to mate with them), ectoplasmic reorganizers (which let Spectrals change their “death” appearance) and Blood Beer (a human-safe alternative for Taylari that don&#039;t want to kill).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The weapons list hits a number of common favorites, such as swords (including the ever-popular katana), axes, chainsaws and ranged weapons from bows to boomerangs to shotguns. Armor is also listed, from chain mail to kevlar and rules for breaking objects.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a pretty big sci-fi aspect to the game as well, and rules are included for cybernetics. You use Bonus Points to buy your enhancements, with “aftermarket” cybernetics being cheaper but coming with some “quirks”. Each basic implant also includes a list of potential upgrades, one of my favorites being the grenade launcher loaded into the cybernetic leg.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Combat is the biggest break I&#039;ve seen in the game, system wise, from anything I&#039;ve played before. Each combat round has 20 Counts, each Count lasting half a second. Everyone rolls initiative, with the winner starting on Count 1, and for every four points that each other participant rolled below him, they start one Count up. I.e., if Zachariah the Taylari rolls an initiative total of 25 and the cyborg killer DED-HED only got a 16, Zachariah starts at Count 1. DED-HED is 9 less than Zachariah, which moves him down the track by three steps, starting him at Count 4. Typically, each character gets two Actions per round, and every action costs both Stamina and Speed. The Speed cost means that performing the action moves you that many spaces down the Combat Tracker. Your opponent can take Reactions, which cost Stamina and Speed, but don&#039;t count against actions. Some of the Reactions have very low Speeds, the lowest being “Take The Hit”...so if you think you can handle what your opponent is swinging with, put your chin out and there&#039;s a good chance you&#039;ll get to strike him next. If you go full defense, he&#039;s liable to keep pressing the attack before you get a go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If your actions taken push you past the Count of 20, then for every Count you go over, you get a -2 on the next Round&#039;s initiative. So if you roll a bad initiative, unless you are just convinced you can take the opponent out, you&#039;re probably better off letting some actions go, and rerolling an unpenalized initiative the next round.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A natural 20 is a big deal on both Actions and Reactions, including bonus damage or, in the case of some Reactions, draining Stamina from the attacker. Similarly, rolling a 1 is bad, no matter what you&#039;re doing when you do it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is just a fairly shocking amount of depth in the combat rules, including an extensive list of Grappling options that include turning an opponent&#039;s weapon on them, using a grappled opponent as a Meat Shield and more. Other combat options including sacrificing Health for Stamina, Feints, and three levels of basic strikes, starting with quicker and weaker and ending with slower and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ranged combat rules remove a common RPG trope, which is the Dodge skill being used with firearms. Doesn&#039;t happen here unless someone is at extremely close range, making guns incredibly useful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The chapter rounds out with a number of common modifiers, such as Targeted Strikes (called shots), Blind Fighting and more, as well as a number of common damage rules such as fire, falling, poison, etc. Finally, a two page example of the combat system, in full glory (including Combat Tracker) for clarification&#039;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, as noted in the styles: It&#039;s definitely crunchy, but I think it&#039;s laid out in such a way that it&#039;s not overwhelmingly so, especially once you get the initiative/combat tracker stuff down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chapter Three brings on the magic section. API magic does spell lists, divided up into 18 “Paths”. Anyone who can cast spells is an Adept. You can dip around into Paths, so you don&#039;t have to focus on any one. The Paths have three Circles, with magic effects getting more and more mindbending as you go. For instance, one of the spells in the 1st Circle of The Path of Death allows you to commune with the dead. With the 2nd circle, you can exorcise spirits. With the 3rd, you can raise the dead (think zombie, not resurrecting a buddy back to full health). Magic is powered by Mana, which you get by converting Stamina.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Half a dozen magical Orders are provided, each focused on a certain type of magic. As well, the book clearly states that magic is not inherently good or evil, but is based off of the intent of the spell...and using magic for good or evil over time can have a transformative effect, making one glow with a holy aura, or aging them prematurely, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As well, while the magic system uses spell lists, you can use experience points to upgrade your spells, tweaking the ones that you like to use, by making them stronger, or less draining to use, and so on. Much like the combat system, the API magic system comes across as a very robust, yet not overwhelming system...with enough crunch to play around in it. If you&#039;re all about freeform magic, you&#039;re probably not going to be thrilled with this...but it does look far less tedious than, say, the D&amp;amp;D tomes of spells system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chapter Four delves into the world in general, and the organization specifically. History, especially in the US, makes a pretty large divergence in 2008 when the first female President is elected, and she manages to dramatically restrict gun ownership rights (remember the paranoia from gunowners when Obama was elected? Yeah, a lot like that, but actually executed by the governnment). API itself has been around in some form since the 1600s, and is a corporation with approximately 120,000 employees. It is a known entity, but just what it really IS is the part that the public is unaware of.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
API has a main HQ in California and a secondary HQ in Florida, with two cells per state, giving you a good amount of flexibility with the campaign structure. As well, there are other worldwide HQs, and the entire HQ structure is given a full page (note that Canada and Europe each have their own sourcebooks while I will review as well).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
API enforces registration on the part of demons, monsters and anyone interacting with the supernatural, and penalties for infractions can range from small fines up through death or incarceration.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As well, API stays on top of all manner of prophecies, be it from The Bible, Nostradamus, The Dead Sea Scrolls or what have you, and tries to discern the true trouble points.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This chapter also delves into the recruitment and training of Agents, as well as providing details on Elite Martial Arts training, which has some cool tricks to it like Mana Leak, which causes an Adept to lose extra Mana when trying to cast a spell after this is hit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The details for an Agent cutting ties with their old life are detailed, which even include subtle DNA alterations...once you&#039;re in the system, you are no longer who you once were. A section is devoted to Agents going rogue, which API does take very seriously...however, since they tend to give their Agents the benefit of the doubt, the Agents tend to do a fair amount of damage before API comes down on them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A sidebar is devoted to The Watchers, a mysterious organization who doesn&#039;t actively interfere with API, but is amassing information at a rapid rate. The belief is that they are hording the information in the event that API fails...but no one has been able to confirm this yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, this chapter also covers the effect of cybernetics on the world, which include underground cybernetic fight clubs and doctors that implant extra goodies in their patients, making cyber-slaves out of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chapter Five deals specifically with demons, such as the Trench Coat Rule (meaning that if a demon is making an attempt to be MOSTLY covered, the human mind will fill in the rest). This chapter also takes the six demonic races from earlier in the book and relays their full racial history, from their home dimension to how they fit into earth society, including how Lochs try to breed with humans and exactly why humans tend to not survive the breeding process.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This chapter is a lot of information that never feels overblown or unnecessary. It is very easy for game settings to go too far to opposite extremes when detailing their racial options...either painting them with too broad of a stroke to make it easy to grasp just how they are different, or go into sooooooo much detail that, frankly, you just stop caring. I think API hits a pretty good sweet spot with this chapter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final chapter is the GMing chapter, starting with the three main themes: action, horror and humor. Common squad structures are provided, as are tips for setting up the game world. A very nice section is included for playing within the game world, but outside of API, from PIs to beings in the supernatural underground to monster hunters who have decided they&#039;ve had enough.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two adventure hooks are given for three difference experience levels (rookies, 30+ xp and 50+ xp), giving you some ideas for what it appropriate for a given group within the setting. Suggested experience awards are also provided here, as well as the point costs for character advancement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A slew of stock statistics are provided, from basic animals to different types of people (normal schmoes, mental patients, monster hunters) to various demon types, including stock stats for the PC races. A Random Demon Maker is also provided, in a d20 table that you roll twice on...this can be used for PCs or a random NPC you need quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The chapter ends with the three “illegal” NPC races: Carriers, Oracles and Tarks. Carriers are often peaceful, but are outlaws because they unleash their digested diseases upon their deaths, leading to a potential pandemic. Oracles, as well, are not inherently evil...but they cause bad luck around them, and since it does not effect them, they tend to not care about the effects. Tarks are sent to earth for the express purpose of abducting babies and toddlers, and thus are treated as pretty much a massive honking threat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book rounds out with a glossary, index, character sheet and combat tracker that you can print off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think parts of the system are going to be a tad crunchy for some folks...but I dig this game. After doing this review, I&#039;d not only love to give the game a spin, but I&#039;m pretty pumped about tackling the rest of the game line. The book is very clearly written, which is a must no matter how crunchy or lite a system is, and while humor is an important part of the setting, the author doesn&#039;t beat you over the head with it like, say, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=55136&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Demon Hunters&lt;/a&gt; (from Margaret Weis Productions) or even the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=2667&amp;amp;it=1&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/a&gt; core rules do. On the flip side, it also doesn&#039;t take itself nearly as seriously as CJ Carella&#039;s Witchcraft or The World of Darkness does. The art in the book isn&#039;t anything GREAT, but I didn&#039;t see anything actively bad, either. Fully functional and thematic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m going to be awfully intrigued to see the Savage Worlds version, as there are some areas where I could see SW really fitting it, and a few areas where I hope API actually steps Savage Worlds up a bit (I&#039;d personally like to see API bring more to the Powers System, rather than just force the Paths into the existing Powers System, but we&#039;ll see).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With good, but not GREAT, production values, Apocalypse Prevention Inc. really brings the goods with the substance, as the corebook alone is chock full of goodies, but the line has a good amount of support ready to go as well. Remember how I said earlier that it reminded me a fair bit of a mixture of d20 and White Wolf stuff? It still does, with a little bit of Palladium thrown in...I just like it a lot more than I do any of the above. Strong recommendation.</content>

                    <content type="html">
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TF3P1bs4F4I/AAAAAAAAAFY/LMDrccTKaP8/s1600/DCA.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TF3P1bs4F4I/AAAAAAAAAFY/LMDrccTKaP8/s320/DCA.jpg&quot; width=&quot;216&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve heard or not, but Green Ronin – makers of Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds – landed one of the two “Holy Grails” in the superhero genre: The DC Comics license.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Their first release in the new line is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82718&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975%20&quot;&gt;DC Adventures Hero&#039;s Handbook&lt;/a&gt;, which is the rulebook and, essentially, the rulebook for Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds 3rd Edition before 3e is officially released. I say essentially, because according to Green Ronin themselves, the only differences between the two will be hardcover vs softcover, the price and the presence of DC material.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Hero&#039;s Handbook PDF is a whopping 281 pages, fully bookmarked and searchable, and chock full of licensed DC art, starting with an Alex Ross cover featuring a selection of iconic DC heroes with Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman (of course) serving as the centerpiece. As is always the case with stuff like this, the art ranges from awesome to so-so, and that&#039;s going to be largely a matter of opinion as to what is what.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ll say this right up front: I&#039;m not going into super heavy detail on the system, except where I see changes worth noting. It&#039;s the d20 system, which has deeply permeated the RPG industry, for better or for worse, since the release of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 3rd edition. I will say that I have only played one iteration of the d20 system that I truly, truly enjoyed, and that was the version presented in Star Wars Saga Edition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The system itself has undergone some changes, but nothing incredibly radical. At the core, it&#039;s still rolling a d20 plus modifiers and, usually, applying it to a target number to determine success. Graded checks are added to the mix, which is an action that has more than just a standard “success or fail” quotient to it, and adds levels of success for every five points you roll above the target number. Another change, and one that I like, is Team Checks. Essentially, Aid Another has been replaced with Team Checks: Rather than the standard +2 for help, the Leader of the Team (though this could be adjusted easily enough to any primary acting character) makes the normal check against the difficulty, while the rest of the team makes a roll against a DC 10. All the degress of success and failure are totaled and if there&#039;s a net failure by two or more degrees, the Leader gets a -2 to his total. A net success grants +2, and if the team manages three or more successes, it becomes +5. It&#039;s not a massive change, but I prefer it over the flat +2.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ability Scores have been reduced to the Ability Modifier that has always been present in d20 games, and the effect this has had on character creation is to change the cost of Abilities from 1 point per rank to 2 points per rank (since you no longer have the “in-between” ranks). The skill list has been somewhat condensed, but still uses the rank system, and is now 1 point for 2 ranks, rather than the 1 point for 4 ranks from 2e. Saves are now Defenses, Feats are now Advantages and have retained the same point costs, while Powers have their own formula based off of the modifiers you select.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Power Level itself is largely still intact from 2nd edition, with a sidebar helpfully noting what would be a good Power Level for a given type of campaign, with a Golden Age game being closer to Power Level 6, while the Justice League is much closer to Power Level 14. Power Level dictates not only the starting number of points, but the limits the PCs can have for Skill Modifiers, Defenses and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every character must select at least two Complications, with one of them being a Motivation. Whenever the Complication comes into play, you score Hero Points, which let you do creative scene editing, improving die rolls, recovering quickly and adding new Advantages for the scene.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As noted, Ability Scores did get overhauled a bit with some name changes, and Base Attack Bonus moved into “Ability Score” status. The new Ability scores now are Strength, Stamina, Dexterity, Agility, Fighting, Intellect, Awareness and Presence, and are now on a -5 to 20 scale (coinciding with the d20 Ability Score Modifiers).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Defenses have been expanded somewhat and now include Dodge, Fortitude, Parry, Toughness and Will, with Dodge and Parry being your defense against ranged and hand to hand attacks, respectively...essentially splitting Reflex and keying Parry to Fighting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skills got trimmed from 29 to 16, which is a huge improvement to me...I just wish they had also reduced the ranks closer to Star Wars Saga&#039;s “Untrained/Skilled/Skill Focus” type approach. Still, you can see why skills are now a touch more expensive in DCA than they were in M&amp;amp;M2e,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The skills section is very clearly written, covering most of the biggest uses of each skill providing target numbers for different effects as needed. For instance, Gather Information has a generalized “Degrees of Success” chart to guide you through setting up your own specialized charts for a given adventure or situation. Close and Ranged Combat are now skills, however they are not broad skills but most be specialized...such as Ranged Combat (Power Ring) or Ranged Combat (Guns) or Close Combat (Swords) and Close Combat (Unarmed). Frankly, this is one of those things that I think is unnecessarily tedious for a supers RPG although, with a high enough linked Ability, you eliminate the need for a lot of ranks in a lot of areas: i.e., if you have Fighting of +4 and Swords of +6, that gives you +10 when sword fighting, but you still have +4 in a fist fight. A guy with +10 in Fighting and no skills is going to whip you in a fist fight and go toe to toe with you in a sword fight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For me, the skills system is and always has been a deal breaker in M&amp;amp;M, and this just doesn&#039;t do enough to fix that for me. We get a condensed skill list...except for all the Close and Ranged Skills. Overall, I would still call it an improvement, just not enough to make me excited about playing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Advantages are still Feats, under a different name. They are even still organized under the same subheadings of Combat, Fortune, General and Skill. In fact, one area where they actually took a step back in the new book is in the big summary chart, where they no longer helpfully mark which Advantages are ranked and which are not. The short sentence description on the table doesn&#039;t even always note it, so without going over the full descriptions list, there is no handy reference as to what is ranked and what is not when making characters. Honestly, other than no longer using the Feats name, I don&#039;t see how this is supposed to be any different from Feats, and the lack of quick reference for which Advantages are ranked and which are not is a very annoying knock here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The same basic structure is still in place for Powers, taking a base cost plus extras, minus flaws, times ranks plus flat modifiers to equal the number of points spent. The list has been broadened far more, relying more on modifiers and descriptors to differentiate powers, shrinking the included list from two full pages to a little under a page and a half. I&#039;m not sure if this makes it better or worse when trying to write up a character, as the excessive modifiers and points totaling was one of those things that turned me off in the past, and it&#039;s certainly no less pronounced here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gadgets &amp;amp; Gear covers everything from basic weaponry through vehicles and headquarters. A basic weapons list is provided with relevant stats such as the ranks of Damage or Ranged Damage each weapon has, critical range and so on. The vehicle provides a standard list of common vehicles, the headquarters section a generic list of HQs...the same list from M&amp;amp;M2e, in fact, with “Sanctum Sanctorum” renamed “Wizard&#039;s Tower”. I know there are whole books set to come out covering the DC Universe in detail, but would it have been that bad to specifically list some DC examples such as The JLA Watchtower, The Batmobile and The Fortress of Solitude? To be fair, many of them are included in the character write-ups later on, but I&#039;m not sure why the need to go QUITE so “generic” here, since this is a DC book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chapter 8 covers the bulk of the system, combat and non, and has some nice additions such as “Challenge Sequences” which are akin to “Skill Challenges”, though they are really only touched on here and not detailed, but if you have dealt with them in Star Wars Saga Edition or D&amp;amp;D Fourth Edition, you&#039;ll definitely see where they were going with it. One addition here I really like is the addition of poison and disease tables with ranks and effects: such as cyanide being a Rank 14 Fortitude Damage effect or AIDS being a Rank 10 disease that Weakens Fortitude, opening the afflicted up to other infections. It does provide some really nice framework to play around with your own poisons and diseases without getting too complicated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Gamemastering chapter does a really nice job of focusing on the game system and working with it, and talks about adventure design in broad strokes, but doesn&#039;t really get into DC specifics until providing four series frameworks at the end of the chapter. It is some good, if generic, advice with a basic adventure structure to hang your plots on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next chapter covers the DCU itself, hitting on all the essential points of the DCU, such as the notable fictional cities like Central/Keystone Cities (home of The Flash), Metropolis, Gotham, Fawcett City (Marvel family), Opal City (Starman), Star City (Green Arrow) and more, with a smaller listing of even more DC specific places of less prominence, like Bludhaven. The hidden city of Nanda Parbat, the nation of Atlantis, fictional Middle Eastern stand-in Qurac and more also get a paragraph or so before the chapter expands out to cover the important features of DC Space, like The Green Lantern Corp, Rann (home of Adam Strange), Thanagar (which has produced earth heroes Hawkman and Hawkgirl), as well as hitting on a handful of the worlds among DC&#039;s 52 universes. This is only meant to be a broad overview, as a book is slated for the line specifically to cover this, and rightfully so: The DC Universe is massive and needs that kind of treatment and I, for one, look forward to seeing the DCU covered in deeper detail, but this is a good start.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chapter 11 selects fourteen prominent heroes and fourteen prominent villains of the DCU and stats them out in game terms, aiming for “iconic” versions of them. For the record, the heroes are: Aquaman (with harpoon hand and magic water hand sidebar variants), Batman (Bruce Wayne), Black Canary, Captain Marvel, The Flash (Barry Allen), Green Arrow, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan, without Yellow weakness), Martian Manhunter, Nightwing, Plastic Man, Robin (Tim Drake), Superman (without electricity powers...I know!), Wonder Woman, and Zatanna. It&#039;s a really strong mix, and the inclusions of Batman, Nightwing and Robin does a nice job of showing how you can take the same basic character type and remake it three (at least somewhat) different ways. People have already complained about some of the stat selections and I have my own issues, but overall, I heartily approve of the choices and would have to think really hard about who I would swap around if I were to change them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The villains are: Black Adam, Black Manta, Brainiac, Catwoman, Cheetah, Circe, Darkseid, Gorilla Grodd, The Joker, Lex Luthor, Prometheus, Sinestro, Solomon Grundy and Vandal Savage. Again, a real strong selection. I dunno if Catwoman could even “iconically” be a villain anymore, she&#039;s been an anti-hero for so long...I probably would have replaced her with Two-Face, The Riddler or even Deathstroke, myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then this chapter concludes with a selection of generic statblocks for bystanders, cops, thugs and other NPCs, as well as basic animal stats.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So...here&#039;s the thing: I was not the target audience for this game. I am a diehard supers geek comic fanboy...but: I&#039;m not a diehard DC fanboy and I&#039;m just not a fan of Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds. I WANT to like it...a ton. The writing on the M&amp;amp;M books has always been just some top notch stuff. It really has been. I keep stacks of their books around just for reference, both in comics writing and in RPG stuff...but the system is just way, way more work than I want to deal with, and nothing in DCA has changed it to be less work...and that&#039;s cool, because they never said they were dramatically overhauling the system, some people (like me) had just hoped that would be the case. Green Ronin has been very up front that this IS M&amp;amp;M3e and that the eventual M&amp;amp;M3e release is basically this, in soft cover, with the DC IP excised. I do think that&#039;s hurt the presentation of the book overall, as they seemed to go out of their way to not “mix” DC material in with “basic” material (such as the lack of specific examples in the Gadgets &amp;amp; Gear chapter), so that it would make for easier editing when time came to release M&amp;amp;M3e. In just about every case, you can practically see the “break point” where the DC material will be seamlessly lifted as though it were never there at all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&#039;re like me and don&#039;t really like the d20 system, there is not enough DC material here to make this worth your purchase. If you love the M&amp;amp;M version of the d20 system but have no interest in the DCU, then hold off for the M&amp;amp;M3e book. If you&#039;ve been chomping at the bit for this because you love the DCU and you dig Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds, then this is absolutely for you. For my part, I felt like they took some small steps forward but there is still far too much work to be done to have a good time. That said, I&#039;ll still be striving to understand the system so that I can take the character and setting books and indulge in a great many adaptations of DC characters for some or all of Marvel SAGA, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=65882&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975%20&quot;&gt;BASH Ultimate Edition&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=81475&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975%20&quot;&gt;ICONS&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

Ever feel like published adventures are too rail-roady? Bedrock Games, makers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=81989&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Terror Network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=81988&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Crime Network&lt;/a&gt;, apparently have a similar complaint. That that end, they have released &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=81986&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Old Country&lt;/a&gt;, a module for Crime Network which is their gangland RPG.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Crime Network, the PCs are soldiers in a mafia family, doing Bad Things with a unique sense of honor. In Old Country, the PCs are given a pretty intense – and harrowing – task: Venture into Sicilian territory, without back-up, and find a traitor who flipped on the Family fifteen years ago. He&#039;s been living in the Witness Protection program ever since, and as his info began to run dry and the feds lost interest, he wormed his way into the Savarino family, where he&#039;s been working his way up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With Old Country, Bedrock Games gives the PCs the situation and drops the right into the middle of it. The GM gets the background on the situation and the little city of Conaca, then the bulk of the adventure is laid out in three types of encounters: Timed Events, which are things that happen regardless, such as church services on Sundays. Investigation events are keyed to places the PCs may search for information, what they may find there, and what it may lead to. Through all of this, the PCs have to worry about Profile Events: Unless the PCs are super careful about how they go about their business, their actions will begin to attract the attention of the Savarinos. Once the Savarinos realize that a rival hit squad is in their territory, they&#039;ll start taking steps to scare them off, which can escalate from there and turn into car bombings and out and out warfare on the streets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ultimately, though, the PCs are given much freedom to do as they will. How hard or easy it turns out to be is partially up to their luck and their choices. Every major NPC in the city is statted out with roleplaying profiles to guide the GM in their interactions with the PCs, including Useful Information the PCs can squeeze out of the NPCs, either by coercion, bribery or sweet talking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Old Country is designed to be used as either a stand-alone module or one to be inserted into the middle of a campaign, with advice on how to appeal to the PCs before sending them in, rather than just making them look like they&#039;re called because they&#039;re available, and a helpful listing of ideas to follow up on the module in your game, such as having the PCs use Conaca as a base of operations to help an allied family in Europe spread their operations, or dealing with repercussions on the PCs home turf as the Savarinos track the PCs back home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The PDF is only $4.99 and clearly laid out, fully searchable and bookmarked. The only problem I see with it, technically, is that the bookmarks are organized...oddly...definitely not in the order they appear in the book, as is common. Incidentally, I noticed that the Crime Network rulebook itself has a similar issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The adventure is a great example of flexible, functional design as it would be a perfect scenario for a one shot, or the tension of the mission could be huge in an ongoing campaign, as the “behind enemy lines” situation gradually (or quickly) worsens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My only previous exposure to an “organized crime RPG” (aside from using The Kingpin a time or two in some Marvel games) has been Gangbusters, and they never had anything quite as cool as Old Country. Technical issues with the bookmarks aside, this is a very fine product. Highly recommended if you want some modern day, seek and destroy, anti-heroic, blood drenched fun.</content>

With the Player&#039;s Guide covered, let&#039;s talk Marshall&#039;s Handbook. Like the Player&#039;s Guide, it is fully featured,…                    </summary>

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TFkc9OoDHxI/AAAAAAAAAEY/ggFnCScV5yc/s1600/deadlandsmarshalls.png&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TFkc9OoDHxI/AAAAAAAAAEY/ggFnCScV5yc/s320/deadlandsmarshalls.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
With the Player&#039;s Guide covered, let&#039;s talk Marshall&#039;s Handbook. Like the Player&#039;s Guide, it is fully featured, with removable layers for easy printing, clocking in at a hefty 162 pages of stats and setting material, fully bookmarked and indexed. In fact, it is a COMPLETE index, of both the Player&#039;s Guide and Marshall&#039;s Handbook, with the former&#039;s pages in parenthesis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82747&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;The Marshall&#039;s Handbook&lt;/a&gt; is utterly not required for the players, and is Marshall specific stuff. Available now in PDF for $19.99, it&#039;s kinda the indispensable guide to running the setting. That said: The Player&#039;s Guide offered up the basic history and the history that those “in the know” know. Y&#039;know? Now, we get the real history. Long time Marshalls know most of this stuff, but new Marshalls need to hear about Raven and The Reckoners, precisely why Fear matters to the Reckoners, why abominations walk the earth, and how this Fear can overwhelm the world. This section also takes the chaos of the Weird West and explains the methods behind the madness...showing the purpose of the actions of the Servitors of the Reckoners.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Marshall-specific Setting Rules are included, such as the effects of Fear Levels and how to lower them, and a slew of awesome tables for when Arcane Backgrounds go awry, or Mad Scientists become just a little more insane. The Veteran o&#039; the Weird West table is also here, for any player brave enough to have taken the Edge, so you can see just what kind of badness they&#039;re saddled with, which can range from owing powerful people a debt, having Night Terrors or even starting off as a Harrowed. Harrowed also get a fairly detailed treatment here, focusing more on a Marshall taking control of a Harrowed due to the host body losing control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each region of the Weird West gets covered, with plot hooks and encounter table, the sole exception being Back East, which doesn&#039;t get an encounter table, but does get a few pages detailing both the North and South back in “civilized” territory.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The actual western territories get a more detailed treatment, beginning with the Disputed Territories of Colorado and Kansas, including perennial old west favorite Dodge City. Helpful advice is provided regarding the types of horrors that are likely to be about (heavy violence is the order of the day, shockingly), with a random encounter table for grins.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Great Basin is Death Valley, The Mojave Desert (home to some big, big worms) and Fort 51, one of the VERY few places with a Fear Level of 0, due to how tightly it is controlled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Great Maze is the what&#039;s left of California, where Reverend Grimme and his City of Lost Angels awaits the winner of The Great Rail Wars, who – one presumes – will have to deal with him before they get the Ghost Rock they seek. Since The Great Maze is such an important feature, this section has both a sea and land encounter table.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Great Northwest is populated with Wendigos and Sasquatches, while the High Plains get you bat-winged demons and more of those big, ugly worms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Deseret is Mormon Country, home of the Wasatch Railroad and Dr. Darius Hellstromme, and also the place you&#039;re most likely to find perversions of science roaming around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Indian Country consumes most of Oklahoma as well as Dakota, and is heavily under the influence of Raven, directly and indirectly. Another perennial western favorite, Deadwood, also lies in Indian Country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, there is the Wild Southwest of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, including Tombstone and the Tombstone Epitaph, the newspaper that helps get all the weird stories out to the people of the Deadlands earth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If there are regions you need or want to see in greater detail, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/index.php?cPath=117_167&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Classic books&lt;/a&gt; are still available in PDF format, at least.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An overview of The Great Rail Wars is provided, including the plans and methods of each railroad, from Hellstromme&#039;s attempts to burrow under The Rockies to Union Blue being under the protection of Abraham Lincoln, who is still around and very much Harrowed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From there it&#039;s off to the abominations and beasties of the setting. Arranged alphabetically, this is just about every major creature that appeared during Deadlands&#039; original run. We have walking dead, animated hands, devil bats, hangin&#039; judges, chupakabras, vampires, werewolves, night ravens, rattlers and much, much more. Most of the monsters have a picture. Every monster has a full description and stats, as well as a list of special abilities. Some abominations, when killed, grant special boons to the Harrowed, and those are listed as well. My only complaint is that, again, it takes a somewhat simplified approach in some areas. We now just have the one set of hangin&#039; judge stats, when Classic introduced actual named hangin&#039; judges, with their own unique quirks and habits. Still, it&#039;s only a minor effort to convert them if you have the classic stats.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just as helpful is a list of human templates: Texas Rangers, Agents, Blessed, Martial Artists, Gunslingers, Indian Braves, Common Townsfolk and more. Just about anything you&#039;ll need statted up and ready to go. I made a band of Indian bounty hunters for one adventure, taking the Brave template and tweaking it differently, three times, getting three similar yet divergent warriors. It&#039;s a very simple matter to do and cuts down on GM prep time even more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then we get named NPCs. Reloaded ended the existence of NPCs without stats, such as the much hated Stone Everyone is statted up and ready to use. I&#039;m not saying the Servitors of The Reckoners, like Stone, aren&#039;t stacked – they very much are...but it&#039;s POSSIBLE to kill them, though I wouldn&#039;t try it before reaching Legendary. With everyone having stats, no one has plot protection anymore. The Rail Barons get their own special section, and then the stat blocks wrap up with mundane animals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book concludes with the Poker Hands chart, the listing of powers by Arcane Background, a character sheet, the index and a big map of the Weird West.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright, like the Player&#039;s Guide, I&#039;m going to be straightforward. This is about as good as gaming gets for me. I love westerns and Savage Worlds lets me get all the awesome of westerns without tediousness or bogging me down in a bunch of extra stuff. I have run Deadlands adventures without supernatural elements, ghost stories, trips into The Hunting Grounds where the heroes fought (and barely survived) a manitou on its home turf, raging gunbattles, nightmare dream sequences, you name it...and I would STILL gladly run it every weekend indefinitely if I had the opportunity. As for Reloaded versus Classic, I never look at a stat block and have to stop and think whether it&#039;s better for a guy to roll 4d8 or 2d10. The stat blocks are cleaner and easier to read, the books are more gorgeous than Classic (thought more expensive, true) and the whole product line is undergoing a fresh revival under Matthew Cutter. Metaplot isn&#039;t hanging over the head of the line like it was in the Classic days. If you want to get the Plot Point books, feel free...if not, you have every last bit of information you need, as a Marshall, to run the setting however you like. With Pinnacle releasing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peginc.com/downloads.html&quot;&gt;conversion notes&lt;/a&gt; for most of the classic adventures for free, I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s been a better time to be a Deadlands Marshall.</content>

Okay, look...this is going to be a fanboyish thing. I apologize for that in advance, but here&#039;s the deal: Deadlands is my favorite setting of all time. Savage Worlds is my favorite in print game system. Deadlands Reloaded kind of rocks my face off. There is a REASON I became a fanboy for both of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Deadlands Reloaded was released in 2006 for Savage Worlds, updating the classic system to fit Pinnacle&#039;s current in-house rules system (and making the fourth official rules system it has appeared in). Being Shane Hensley&#039;s baby, it was released in full color hardcover for about $40, and – combined with the Savage Worlds Explorer&#039;s Edition – was everything you needed for adventuring in the Weird West.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Four years later and instead of a standard second printing, new Deadlands Brand Manager Matthew Cutter decided to cut the tome in two, giving us once again a Player&#039;s Guide and a Marshall&#039;s Handbook. Now, disclaimer: If you already own Deadlands Reloaded, you can get both the errata and the rules updates for free from Pinnacle&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peginc.com/Downloads/Deadlands/DLRSecondPrintingAdditions.pdf&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. If not, then let&#039;s take a look at the Deadlands Reloaded books, see if it&#039;s what you want, starting with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/index.php?manufacturers_id=27&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975%20&quot;&gt;Player&#039;s Guide&lt;/a&gt;, now available in PDF format for $14.99.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Deadlands is an awesomely creepy campy western horror mix. During the Battle of Gettysburg, all the dead got up and started attacking both sides, digging the Civil War into more of a cold war as things just went increasingly south (no pun intended) from there. Ghost Rock, a powerful fuel with a disturbing secret, was discovered in California after an earthquake shattered the coast, and Rail Barons have been waging a bloody war to beat each other to the coast and be the ones to funnel the Ghost Rock back East for mass production. Crazy folk tales and legends have come to life and strange scientific gadgets have begun circulating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Does that sound like your cup of tea? Yeah? Then jump aboard. No? Well, I&#039;m not misleading you about the contents. Not sure? Keep reading.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Deadlands Reloaded Player&#039;s Guide is everything you need if you want to be a player. The PDF weighs in at 129 pages, full color, searchable, bookmarked and layered so you can remove the gorgeous backdrops for easier printing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first 22 pages or so is all background material that the players should know, up through 1879, where the Civil War has hit on a cease fire after nearly two decades of war, once it was revealed (in a Classic Deadlands module) that the CSA President was not who he claimed he was. Under President Grant, the US has fractured into much smaller “country-states”, as the Union lacks the power and ability to enforce its sovereignty, or challenge the sovereign claims of other nations, such as the Confederate States and the Mormon nation Deseret. Also included here are some mechanical bits, like penalties for riding in a saddle long distances, as well as some “life in the west” type stuff like communications in 1879. A handy chart of crimes and their punishments are included, as well as a discussion of the law enforcement structure. The Union fields The Men in Black Dusters -for the supernatural types - and the US Marshalls (for more mundane threats), while the CSA has the Texas Rangers, who kind of do both jobs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Makin&#039; Heroes provides a list of common character types for a Deadlands game, like Muckrakers, Grifters, Law Dogs and Hucksters to use as inspiration. Then we get to Deadlands specific character rules. The only race is Human, which means everyone gets a Free Edge. Grit is a new secondary attribute added, which helps out with things like being scared, and it goes up as you get more experienced.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New Edges and Hindrances follow, pretty much all of which are conversions from Deadlands Classic. Now, that&#039;s not to say that every Edge and Hindrance from Classic made it into Reloaded, which they didn&#039;t...but perennial favorites like Grim Servant o&#039; Death and Veteran of the Weird West are present and accounted for. Also included are Legendary Edges such as Behold A Pale Horse..., which makes your mount a Wild Card, complete with chips and the Danger Sense Edge or Fast As Lightning, which lets you treat any initiative card lower than a 10 as being a 10.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gear &amp;amp; Goods covers all the weapons and equipment you&#039;ll likely need, from the basic versions on down to the El Cheapo versions for when funds are running low. As has always been the case, there are more firearms here than I&#039;ve ever used while GMing the game, but that&#039;s how it goes sometimes. Also included are Infernal Devices, inventions of mad scientists powered by Ghost Rock, such as flamethrowers and air gyros. They are usually very powerful, but expensive to own and operate, and can have some dangerous malfunctions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Setting Rules chapter talks about Grit – gaining it and how it affects gameplay, as well as Fate Chips. Deadlands Reloaded eschews the bennies of Savage Worlds for the Fate Chips of Deadlands Classic, which are red, white and blue poker chips, drawn at random at the beginning of the session. White chips grant you rerolls, allow you to soak wounds and remove Shaken results. Red chips can add a d6 to your result, but doing so allows the Marshall a free draw from the pot himself. Red chips can also be used as whites. Blue chips can do anything red or white chips can do, and never grant the Marshall a chip draw. If you have earned an elusive Legend chip, they can grant you that d6, but you get an additional +2 on top of it. They can also allow you to reroll ANY one roll, including damage rolls. Finally, if you choose, you can trade it in for a bonus experience point at the end of a session. This is one of the updates to Reloaded, as it brings the experience rules in line with Savage Worlds, removing the ability to cash in (non-Legend) chips for experience points.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Deadlands adds its own specific firearm rules, such as fanning the hammer on single action guns (firing a lot of shots at once, basically) and a dueling system that takes its cue from Texas Hold &#039;em Poker. We&#039;ve used the dueling rules once in play, and it ended very badly for the PC (luckily for him it was a dream sequence), but it ratcheted up the tension nicely. The key in the duel is to a) make it at least appear as though the opponent broke and pulled their gun first, and b) kill them. It requires a mix of speed, accuracy and willpower to pull it off, and with the right hand of cards, it is entirely possible to kill a foe with one shot during a duel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Gamblin&#039; rules get an updated in the new printing, using the non gunfiring steps of the duel, which I haven&#039;t had a chance to try out. You can still use the standard gambling rules for most games, but with a plot-intensive card game, but these out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, we get Hangin&#039; rules, which pretty much tells you how quickly you die if you&#039;re hanged. This may seem excessive, but watch enough westerns and you can see how it can matter, especially if you&#039;re neck&#039;s in the noose and your rifleman buddy is drawing a bead on the rope, hoping to save you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No Man&#039;s Land is for when you want to venture into the arcane side of things...be it as a Blessed agent of God, a superpowered martial artist, a magic wielding Huckster, an Indian shaman blessed by the spirits, a Mad Scientist or a member of the Texas Rangers or Agency. This chapter provides not only the rules for each Arcane Background, but relevant Edges such as Dealer&#039;s Choice which can allow a Huckster to spend a Fate chip to redraw any card for any reason, or Flock, which grants a Blessed followers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many of the Arcane Backgrounds got overhauled fairly dramatically in Deadlands Reloaded, to fit the Savage Worlds powers scheme. Blessed have access to every power on their list so long as they make their Faith roll. Hucksters no longer HAVE to deal with manitou for their power, so long as they have Power Points to fuel their abilities with. One big addition to the new printing is that Mad Scientists, once they are Legendary, can take the Eureka! Edge, which grants them the ability to make Infernal Devices. Similarly, Shamans are now no longer required to take The Old Ways Oath, meaning that you can have a gun-wielding Shaman if you choose. A lot of the Arcane Backgrounds use the same powers reskinned, which is common in Savage Worlds, but they do cover a lot of ground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Harrowed are also discussed at the end of the Player&#039;s Guide, for those who need it. Harrowed are the dead who don&#039;t stay dead, digging themselves back out of the ground with a demon floating around in their head, fighting for control. This also includes a listing of common Harrowed powers...enough for the basic Harrowed, but not nearly the breadth of abilities found in the Classic system&#039;s Book o&#039; the Dead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a long time Deadlands player, I got used to a LOT of things that aren&#039;t in the Player&#039;s Guide (or Reloaded) anymore. Classic had rules for werewolf and vampire PCs. Those have been left behind in Classic...this matters to me, though, because one of my players had a PC who became a werewolf, so that was problematic. The various Arcane Backgrounds had a ton of powers and tricks that have also been left on the cutting room floor, like Huckster&#039;s cantrip-like Tricks and Shaman&#039;s Totems. However, I still have all of my old Deadlands books, and I&#039;m not afraid to add a little more crunch for my own games.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book concludes with a listing of the Poker Hands and their effects on a Huckster&#039;s Dealings with the Devil, a list of what backgrounds access what powers, a character sheet and an index.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, like I said, it&#039;s not a perfect conversion, at least not for me. There was some detail removed that I really, really enjoyed, but I understand why it was excised. Luckily, I&#039;m not afraid to tinker with the old stuff I have to make it new, whether it fits the Savage Worlds design philosophy or not. Also, we haven&#039;t played with the most recent rules additions yet, but we have played a fair amount of Deadlands, both classic and Reloaded. Our Huckster player wasn&#039;t pumped about the addition of Power Points, but the overall agreement is that what little (and it&#039;s really just a little) flavor that was lost has been more than made up for with the ease and speed of play. We had gotten pretty darn fast with the Classic rules, but we can do full Reloaded sessions in four hours or less, and that&#039;s without skimping on combat or role-playing. Deadlands has had such a huge impact on me that I can&#039;t watch a Western without wanting to crack out the cards, dice, chips and books and have a go at it. We&#039;ve had characters maimed, killed, stalked by the ghosts of the people they&#039;ve killed, lost in The Deadlands, tormented by the demonic memories of wicked old schoolmarms, turned into werewolves, hunted by werewolf hunters, fought giant automatons, and been utterly creeped out by disembodied crawling hands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Deadlands is the most fun I&#039;ve ever had as a player, and is easily some of the most fun I&#039;ve ever had as a GM. It has provided laughs, chills and “Hot damn!” moments galore, so it&#039;s hard for me not to give it excessively high praise. The Player&#039;s Guide cleans up the editing issues present in the original Deadlands Reloaded release, and maintains the same gorgeous production values.</content>

                    <content type="html">
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TFinLFyONSI/AAAAAAAAAEI/NngNjqTS7ao/s1600/road-trip-612.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TFinLFyONSI/AAAAAAAAAEI/NngNjqTS7ao/s320/road-trip-612.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Monsters and Other Childish Things&lt;/i&gt; was a game I came into ownership of a couple of years ago during a series of trades on RPG.net, and it was an incredibly pleasant surprise. Just a very evocatively written book and a really cool premise, I just haven&#039;t ever really figured out what to do with it. I was very pleased when I had the opportunity to review &lt;i&gt;Road Trip&lt;/i&gt;, the new mega-adventure for &lt;i&gt;MaOCT&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Road Trip&lt;/i&gt; is perfectly timed for the summer, beginning with the end of school and hooking the kids and their monsters into a, well, road trip across the United States as they try to halt a nefarious plot that could mean the end of the world. No, really, that&#039;s an actual outcome of the adventure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Road Trip&lt;/i&gt; is a non-linear adventure designed as a series of quirky set-pieces meant to be played in any order, other than the first and last adventures, which (obviously) start and stop the adventure. Along the way, the PCs can experience glimpses into the underworld, encounter urban legends and even mundane fun like running out of gas or flat tires.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m going to go light on spoilers, seeing as how this is an adventure and I wouldn&#039;t want someone&#039;s fun spoiled by players reading all about it here, while still trying to give a good overview of the material. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82567&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Road Trip&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; PDF is an impressive 202 pages, which includes post cards (that are actual in game props), fully searchable, bookmarked, and featuring a clickable table of contents. It retails for $14.99 in PDF, or $29.99 in softcover. The book begins with the history of the Ur-Monster, an ancient being possibly older than The Great Old Ones. This thing is kinda important to the adventure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite being pretty open for customization, the book makes certain assumptions about the world and gives you said assumptions, so that if you decide to change something, you have an idea as to what is affected. The book also assumes a modern setting, but provides some tips on switching up eras as you like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One thing I loved right off the bat is that it is designed for two to four kid/monster pairs. I almost always play in very small groups, and so it annoys me that adventures tend to always assume four to six players. I am far more likely to wind up running this just because of the smaller group size, honestly. This chapter also provides tips on setting the adventure in a non-modern day setting and how it&#039;ll influence the various regions in the book. There&#039;s also a section on rewards, as the PCs can gain valuable insight about the Ur-Monster and its Cult if they are particularly successful on their missions. In fact, every mission can go a couple of different ways, and impact the final chapter by influencing the preparedness of the PCs as well as the enemies and allies present.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New mechanics are also introduced, such as Threats, which abstracts problematic situations into a die pool similar to, but not exactly like, a monster&#039;s die pools. Homesickness is a nice little feature that all the kids have to begin rolling for after their first stop on the road, the severity of which can be nothing to losing a die in a skill, an attribute and a relationship! However, Homesickness can be fought, and if fought successfully, can be beneficial. The third mechanic, Lessons of the Road, allows PCs to potentially gain bonuses after recovering points lost due to Homesickness, giving them an edge due to their trials. The Threats mechanic are applicable in any &lt;i&gt;MaOTC&lt;/i&gt; game, while Homesickness and Lessons of the Road are nice touches for the theme.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story begins with the PCs being visited by a strange boy named Jack, whose monster Basil has gone missing. Jack believes that the baddies that have taken Basil are after the PCs next, and tries to form an alliance of convenience, which sets the PCs afoul of Jack&#039;s enemies. Once this is completed, it is very likely that one or more kid/monster sets are in danger of disappearing from the world forever, unless the PCs rally and defeat the bad guys, giving them good reason to embark on their road trip. At this point, the aforementioned post cards kick in, with Jack doing what he can to help the PCs make it to their next destination (wherever that may be). Once the PCs are on board with going on a road trip, then it&#039;s all up to figuring out the “how”. The book provides a number of alternatives but assumes none, so if the PCs come up with something, let &#039;em run with it. If not, there is plenty of advice. A helpful checklist of necessary needs are included, as well as pros and cons of things like having parental units around (no homesickness vs much sneaking around). Once the method is determined, the kids are off!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As mentioned before, once the first chapter is finished, there is no assumed order for the next chapters. In New England, the PCs are drawn into the middle of war between an insane farm owner and the intelligent animals, led by the intelligent, talking rabbit he was once friends with, who live there. Each chapter has a section detailing what the PCs&#039; adversary hopes to accomplish in each place. For all the detail provided, the adventures does not dictate the PC&#039;s actions, though this struggle is fated to erupt into full scale war not long after the PC&#039;s arrive. The side they are on will be up to them and their actions, which can have immense ramifications on the future of the story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In California, the PCs get to encounter an homage to a certain famous kids show about multicolored ninjas as they encounter a small town that is unusually targeted by giant monsters. As you may imagine, these rainbow ninjas are awfully suspicious of monsters, thus complication #1, and so the PCs are presented with the task of helping them find their missing mentor while potentially having to battle the very people they are trying to aid. As with the previous chapter, there is far more going on behind the scenes than appears on the surface, and success or failure is at least partially dependent on the methods used.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Las Vegas provides the ultimate nightmare: A daycare prison. The kids who have been left behind have banded together into Playground Gangs, which means the PCs will have to at least dabble in Playground Politics before they can unlock the secrets of Sucrose Park, and perform a prepubescent prison break.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kansas provides a trip to a famous destination, as the kids get to play stormchaser in order to travel to the Emerald City of Oz, which is reaching a boiling point as factions in the city are divided over how best to govern and the children have the opportunity to play Kingmaker...literally. This one has the most “rail-roady” of outcomes...but also has some of the broadest ramifications based off of the actual choices made by the PCs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Florida provides a timeless everglade where missing kids have joined in a parentless rule, ala Lord of the Flies but a little less violent and nihilistic. Again, as with the previous adventures, there is a lot more going on behind the scenes than appears on the surface, and there is the possibility for a big misstep or two here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once all the chapters are finished, it&#039;s time for the grand climax of the &lt;i&gt;Road Trip&lt;/i&gt;, hosted at a certain infamous government facility in Nevada. Precisely how this plays out is dependent on how well the previous chapters went: Successes bolster the PCs, failures bolster the enemies. Decisions made by the PCs affect the allies available to them, and possibly the enemies they face. A number of options are presented for the grand finale, including an extended battle with cultists, a more peaceful approach toward ending the summoning of the Ur-Monster, and a gigantic, Godzilla-sized battle between The Ur-Monsters and the PC monsters, depending on how you and your players are feeling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ending options are provided, ranging from a clean wrap-up to the End of the World.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two appendices follow, one on Underworld Tremors, which are little asides that can be inserted throughout the campaign to remind the PCs about just why they are racing against the clock, and a wide variety of Roadside Encounters, from getting lost to phantom hitchikers (with a very cute twist) to The Speed Trap from Hell to rumors of local haunted houses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two extended encounters follow in the final two appendices, not directly related to the main story at all, including a mini zombie rampage using the Threat rules.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So: Thoughts on &lt;i&gt;Road Trip&lt;/i&gt;? I like it. A good variety of adventures, all linked to a larger outcome, but providing a great mix of roleplay solutions, problem solving and good old fashioned combat. Every adventure is well detailed while still providing a lot of flexibility for whatever solutions the players provide. Honestly, I wish more adventure books were written like this. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s railroady any more than asking the players to buy into any given premise is railroady...with the exception of one adventure, whose outcome seems to be a foregone conclusion, but even then the “how” the PCs arrive to that conclusion can have startling ramifications for the campaign climax.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you like &lt;i&gt;MaOTC&lt;/i&gt;, or if you think you do and you&#039;re just not sure what to DO with it, buy this. I doubt you regret it.</content>

                    <content type="html">
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TFbK1NTO_SI/AAAAAAAAAEA/vh9m7PLQm40/s1600/newepoch.jpg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TFbK1NTO_SI/AAAAAAAAAEA/vh9m7PLQm40/s320/newepoch.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82594&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The New Epoch Character Codex&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is pretty much exactly what it says on the tin: It is the character creation guide for the New Epoch roleplaying game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That, then, begs the question: What is &lt;i&gt;The New Epoch&lt;/i&gt;? &lt;i&gt;The New Epoch&lt;/i&gt; is a fantasy RPG set in a steampunkish Industrial Age. This 146 page PDF has all of the character generation rules for the game, and is apparently the first of six volumes that will make up the sum totality of the &lt;i&gt;New Epoch&lt;/i&gt;. The cover features a cleavagey, steampunk girl seemingly crawling through a duct or tunnel of some sort, and the book itself is a full color, well laid out tome with a distinct visual design. The art reminds me a bit of the better parts of D&amp;amp;D 3rd Edition&#039;s “DungeonPunk” style taken on to a steampunk extreme.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The PDF is not bookmarked, though it is searchable and does have a table of contents, as well as an index, so points there for sure. It boasts 13 races, though that&#039;s a slight misnomer as there are seven main races, divided into subraces. It also features 10 classes and advertises itself as using the “d20 System”, but this is not the d20 system we know and love (or loath, depends on who you are). While it looks very much like a product that might have been released in the heyday of the d20 era, it is not, so don&#039;t go into it expecting full compatibility with your D&amp;amp;D or Pathfinder books, because that&#039;s not what you&#039;re going to get, even though it is very deliberately trying to sell itself that way (the RPGnow Product listing files it under d20/OGL).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That said, the system DOES use the same basic mechanic: roll a d20, add or subtract modifiers, compare to a target number. It diverges dramatically with the “Vitals” which are what you normally consider Ability Scores, Skills (which include weapon skills), and an Abilities system that we&#039;ll get into a bit later on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The introductory chapter implies that the eventual release of the game will be in a boxed set, with all six books in softcover. I have to say, that sounds very appealing, though I wonder at the price point, since – if this pricing holds – the six PDFs alone will run about $72...a core buy-in more expensive than what you can get the D&amp;amp;D 4th Edition and Warhammer 3rd Edition core for in print.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first chapter gives a step by step walkthrough of character creation. Not as robust as some examples, but pretty clear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The game assumes that you begin at level 0, especially if you&#039;re new to it, though you can always start at higher levels. You select race and class and build from there. You will apparently have three classes over the life of the character: A basic class, an advanced class and a faction class. Once you change classes, you can&#039;t go back, kind of like dual-classing from Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 2e. In fact, much like AD&amp;amp;D2e, you retain all of your previous abilities, you just don&#039;t continue advancing in that class.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Level advancement also requires a night of rest, so no mid-dungeon level-ups without a safe haven. The main downside I see to that mechanic is a bit of metagaming where the players turtle up somewhere as soon as they have enough experience points, but you&#039;re going to get that in a lot of games anyway, so it&#039;s a minor quibble.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chapter two delves into races, which has four varieties of humans, each tied to a certain region and lifestyle. Dwarves are actually mechanical men in this setting, which is a cool twist, with two different varieties. Elves also have two varieties, a dark-skinned version that live underground called Draugh, and an effete, above ground version called Riven. Greenskins encompass orcs, goblins and hobgoblins, while halflings are present as kind of a mishmash of the D&amp;amp;D “little people”, one subset being Sky Gypsies and another as Holm Tinkers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What can I say? If you&#039;ve played fantasy RPGs, there&#039;s not a lot that&#039;s terribly new here, except for the dwarves being mechanical men. While the greenskins have “troublemaker” like traits, they aren&#039;t inherently evil, and have all found their niches in society. Each race has their abilities and Vital modifiers listed, as well as a paragraph or so detailing what each was up to at any given era in the game setting&#039;s history. The art, again, looks very nice...but there is also a definite feel of “been there, done that” in some places.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ten basic classes are covered in chapter three, and are: Arcanist – the big, bad wizard, Bard – meant to take on more of a leader role in this game than normal, Berserker – a raging, combat tank, Channeler – who channels divine might, Explorer – a scholar and tactician, Gunner – he shoots stuff, Mechanist – which is apparently an unarmed fighter, Necrolyte – a spell-caster focusing on creepy magics, Rogue – the slippery, sneaky type, and Warder – whose primary role on the field is to defend their fellows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each class has a history of the class in the world, the likely races who will flock to it, the common characteristics of those in the class, their main weapons and armor, vitals adjustments, skills, the main features of the class, the starting equipment, and the Disciplines you have access to, as well as the potential you have in a discipline. Each Discipline has ten abilities, and minor potential lets you learn up to five of them, while major potential lets you learn potentially all of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are some nice twists through the classes: Arcanists are damage beasts at long range, Berserkers can actually influence their allies with their fury, Mechanists are essentially steampunk cyborgs – beings who keep grafting on augmentations to be better warriors. The classes all feel distinct from one another, and while some hit on classic fantasy archetypes (rogues) and others borrow inspiration from fantasy standards (explorers gain a “favored enemy” bonus similar to D&amp;amp;D Rangers), it feels a little more forgivable here than it does in the races. That said, this section needs a lot of editing, as the same paragraph was apparently cut and pasted multiple times under the weapons section of various classes, but the “gunner” reference wasn&#039;t changed. Similarly, the Explorer class indicates in bold text that it gets three ranks of Arcanist Discipline for free, but the chart underneath it clearly disagrees. Definitely want to clean that up before you go to print with it in any format.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chapter four discusses the Vitals in detail, those being Agility, Power, Mass, Stamina, Ethos, Logic and Vigor. Vigor is the only one I find to be an odd choice here as I tend to relate it to physical health, but they use it to focus more on willpower. Just feels a tad counter intuitive. Each stat is tied into the world&#039;s cosmology, which four elemental planes (Air, Earth, Fire, Water) and three ethereal planes (Divinos, Arcanos, Occultos)...with each stat representing one of those planes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These make up, along with the Prime Material and Prime Immaterial Planes, the Inner Planes. Apparently there were once Outer Planes, which have since disappeared from The World Mechanism. On one hand, this seems like a very odd place to suddenly dive into the cosmology, but on the other hand, I very much like how it is all tied directly into the Vitals. At level 0, you combine the Vitals from your Race and Class, and every time you go up a level, you can add 1 rank to any Vital...however, you can&#039;t have a Vital that is more than 1/3 of your total levels. Each Vital has a section talking about how a high Vital affects your character from a roleplaying standpoint, as well as what weapons and skills are going to benefit the most from said Vital. A very helpful layout of the Vitals and their effects in game...however, again, that cosmology seems awfully derivative...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next part of the chapter provides 100 character traits, as well as 100 opposing character traits, all handily numbered so you can make a d100 roll for random generation. I believe this&#039;ll benefit people far more for NPCs than PCs, but you never know. The cool part is that each trait is, in fact, directly opposed by the one on the same position at the opposite chart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chapter five helps you calculate your passives, which are derived stats like encumbrance, speed, defenses (think d20&#039;s three Saves, renamed), Health and Steam (which is used to power your abilities). One nice bit here as that firearms don&#039;t attack your “Dex” defense, but your “Wits” instead. One who is sharp of mind will be out of position of those before one who is a bit slower on the uptake.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you run out of Health or Steam, you become Beaten – which doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re OUT of it, but you wind up with basically -10s to everything, and one more direct hit can kill you. However, once you hit Beaten, you don&#039;t fully recover until you FULLY recover – both Health and Steam have to hit their maximums again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One big complaint I have here is that the formulas partially use numbers, and partially use symbols that I don&#039;t immediately recognize. I must have missed them somewhere, but I just don&#039;t know what the little helmet means, or the scales, or so on. Oh, wait, there is a key. Still, I think the sudden addition of the symbols was unnecessarily jarring.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chapter six, Skills, largely eschews non-adventuring skills, arguing that an adventurer doesn&#039;t have time to make armor, build houses and the like. Weapon skills are divided into Families: Arcane, Divine, Martial, Occult, Projectile and Scientific, then further broken down by weapon. Utility skills are everything else, and include everything from Ride and Swim to Stealth, Charisma and Break (which is what you use to smash down doors).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every skill has a listing that details the uses of it further, including Target Numbers for common functions. I have a big pet peeve about giant skill lists, but I&#039;m okay with this one...larger than I like, but it doesn&#039;t feel excessive. You get the skill bonuses that your class gives you, and improve it by improving the related Vitals and such.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next up is equipment. Prices are all listed in shillings, though there are four types of currency of differing values. A large listing of weapons follows with all the vital stats, followed by a good number of pictures of weapons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Armor can be gain Dents, which diminish its effectiveness in reducing damage to you. And yes, Armor reduces damage, and doesn&#039;t make you harder to hit, another d20 departure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is followed by adventuring standards, such as flint, bedroll, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final chapter is Abilities, and this takes up the better part of 50 pages. Every Discipline has ten abilities, which must be bought in order, and every Ability can be improved twice beyond its starting level. As mentioned before, every class that has access to a Discipline either has major or minor potential, meaning they can either learn all the abilities, potentially, or can learn half the abilities. This is all listed in both the Class chapter, as well as immediately under each Discipline&#039;s heading in this chapter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are some nice abilities in here: Alchemy has Laughing Gas, which can shut spellcasters down, Smog Wall which creates a cloud virtually impossible to see through and Rock Foam, which quickly hardens and incapacitates foes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Arcanist has Elemental Spray, which is a basic attack that can be changed up as need be, Teleport, which does what it says on the tin, and A Stitch in Time, which gives your allies time “hiccups” that grant them extra actions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bards can use Counter Songs that block enemy&#039;s magic, Heroic Ode&#039;s that inspire his allies, and Circle of Heroes, which grants every ally in range an additional attack, complete with damage bonus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Berserker has the kind of rage filled powers you would expect, but his ultimate power allows him to manifest a shadowy twin of the very darkness driving him to such a rage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are 42 Disciplines in all, with a total then of 420 Abilities in this book, an impressive amount of options. That said, there is a heavy combat focus, even in areas you wouldn&#039;t normally think of (such as Clarity, which can grant you True Strike, which is an automatic critical hit). Still, this isn&#039;t entirely true, such as Cryptology which lets you animate a quill to map for you, or allows you to draw an item that then becomes real.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After the extensive Abilities Listing, the Codex concludes with an index and character sheet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So...my final thoughts. This is hard. I always look for the positive in RPG reviews...I don&#039;t like to crap on anyone&#039;s work, period...but I also strive to be fair and honest. I wasn&#039;t asked to review this, as is sometimes the case...it was something that caught my eye on RPGnow, and so I picked it out for a review. The fantasy steampunk looked cool, and so I went with it. It&#039;s heavily inspired by Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Combine that with the misleading “d20” logo (not the classic one, but what are you going to think of when you see “d20 System” on the cover of a book?), and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I don&#039;t know the history of the project...it may have been in the works for D&amp;amp;D 3.5, then they changed their minds after WotC went 4th Edition, I don&#039;t know. Combine that with a release plan that&#039;s apparently aiming for six core books with the price point they&#039;re looking at right now...eek. I mean, the character creation alone is $12 in PDF format. High Valor is a whole game for $12 in PDF format...and there is not really enough here to play the game, just create your characters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That being said: it looks great. It needs some editing, and I would add bookmarks, but other than that? Nice work. Even with the heavy D&amp;amp;D inspiration, there are some cool things in here. I don&#039;t own any steampunk fantasy RPGs (other than the first Iron Kingdoms monster book). I like enough of what I see here that I would seriously consider making it my first. I think the boxed set with six softcover books, if they can hit the right price point, would be great. I really would like to see the other five books, and I would love to see it expand on the promise of this one, while minimizing the reliance on its inspiration. The system, from what&#039;s presented in this volume, feels cleaner and like less work than the d20 system does, and that&#039;s a huge plus...but I can still only give this a very mild recommendation until the rest of the line develops and we see that a) the other five books will surface (companies with proven track records have had vapor ware, you know) and b) if the game is going to walk its own path, or continue treading the road already beaten. I will be keeping an eye out on this one, though.</content>

&lt;i&gt;The Pine Ridge Horror&lt;/i&gt; is a new PDF adventure for Savage Worlds that was just released by Silver Gryphon Games, maker of such goodness as &lt;i&gt;Wellstone City&lt;/i&gt;. Written by David Baymiller and featuring the art of Storn Cook, &lt;i&gt;The Pine Ridge Horror&lt;/i&gt; is a one shot action/horror adventure that can be dropped into an existing game, or used to launch a game if so desired. One of the cool things about Savage Worlds is that the number of players don&#039;t matter, as the game runs so smoothly with the PCs handling multiple NPCs, that you can run a game with one player and still have a whole party.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I should note now that I absolutely love Savage Worlds. It is, without a doubt, my favorite in-print game system, and my second favorite system of all time. While I have never reviewed a Savage Worlds product before, I can say without hesitation that it is my first impulse for running anything shy of a supers game (Marvel SAGA is still the king in my book).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Weighing in at 18 pages and running $2.25 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82609&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;RPGnow&lt;/a&gt;, the only other product that you will need for this is the &lt;i&gt;Savage Worlds Explorer&#039;s Edition&lt;/i&gt;. The adventure is set in the 70s, right after the end of the Vietnam war, in the Pine Ridge Forest near South Dakota. Two boys have found a camp utterly slaughtered and alerted the Rangers, and that&#039;s where the adventure begins.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The adventure is written under the assumption that the PCs are either Park Rangers or volunteers along for the hunt for the bears that CLEARLY tore apart the camp. However, there is another, more “horror movie” option provided in a sidebar, where the PCs are just playing campers who stumble upon the mess themselves. You can even mix and match the options, if you like. It wouldn&#039;t be a big stretch to have someone as part of a group of horny teens out camping and others as volunteers on the hunt. That gives you a large potential bodycount to play around with, if you like. The only downside to the “campers” option, is that I could see the adventure being REALLY tough to survive for “normal” teens...whereas you have some room for “badass” with the Ranger volunteer option.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The adventure is laid out timeline style over the course of two days. The first day is all about building the tension, with false alarms and red herrings. The hunting party consists of six NPCs to go along with any PCs, with personalities specifically designed to add a little extra tension to the mix, of course. This can all help with the tension building, and allows more room for fun when, say, an NPC fails a Fear check and starts firing at random.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I will be playing light with spoilers here, but I will say that by nightfall, the PCs will have a very clear idea that it&#039;s Not Bears they are dealing with, and by dawn on the second day, the body count will begin.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In true horror movie fashion, the second day will bring a Mysterious Stranger From The Woods Who Knows Far More Than He&#039;s Willing To Talk About, and probably just in time, too. The whole thing builds to a bloody siege in the Stranger&#039;s Cabin, and it is very much an over the top, Savage Worlds version of a horror movie climax.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Pine Ridge Horror&lt;/i&gt; should be a great way to spend an evening of gaming and, as mentioned, you can use it completely stand alone, launch into a new campaign, or even drop it into an existing campaign. You can change the era with little problems...just if you modernize it, make the woods a cellphone deadzone. Just trust me.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Also, my advice: Play it straight, with the PCs as hunters and not as teen revelers in the woods. I could EASILY see teens, especially with, say, a single gun between them, getting themselves killed – possibly by the end of the first night. I could be wrong, but the real threat of the Pine Ridge Horror should be PLENTY dangerous enough to give you all the tension you need.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Very strong recommendation. Silver Gryphon Games have added a wonderful addition to the Savage Worlds line-up.</content>

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TFLkrg2ZYiI/AAAAAAAAADo/RYmWq2LC1XM/s1600/PANFF01E_500.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_v7xUOmoI9e8/TFLkrg2ZYiI/AAAAAAAAADo/RYmWq2LC1XM/s320/PANFF01E_500.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
“Fortune&#039;s Fool” is a Shakespearean turn of phrase that says that men are just puppets under Fate&#039;s control. It&#039;s also a new role-playing game by Pantheon Press that places the heroes of the game largely at the mercy of a Tarot deck, known in the game as a Fate Deck.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Fortune&#039;s Fool&lt;/i&gt; is set in an alternate history Earth filled with the usual fantasy races such as elves, dwarves, halflings, orcs and goblins. So, if you don&#039;t like orcs, dwarves and elves? Nothing to see here. Move along. Come back in a few days and I&#039;ll review something else.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Set in Renaissance Europe, the book attempts to disperse the fantasy races around logical areas, such as concentrating dwarves to the north, placing the elves in France, and so on. Though orcs and goblins are frowned upon by society at large, they are not inherently evil, being a PC option.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The book itself is a softcover, digest sized black and white product retailing for $20 (with a limited, full color version for $35 and a PDF for $10), though it does require a Tarot Deck in order to play. Other than a crazy girlfriend who had a tarot deck, I didn&#039;t know much about them and so I thought I could substitute my Ravenloft Tarokka deck...I was wrong.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The system, as mentioned, relies on a tarot deck. Generally, you just draw a card and if it&#039;s equal to or lower than the relevant stat or skill, you succeed. If not, you fail. In addition, the different suits of the Minor Arcana are designated as Fortune Smiles or Fortune Frowns, and most of the Major Arcana will be noted as Fortune Shines or Fortune Weeps. These help determine the level of success or failure. If you have an extra chance of success, that&#039;s a Double Draw, meaning you draw two cards and take the best one. If you have an extra chance of failure, that&#039;s a Double Black Draw, and you have to draw twice and take the worst.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Character creation is somewhat reminiscent of a lifepath system, in which you make a number of decisions that decide your character&#039;s stats, which are Agility, Body, Heart, Perception, Status and Martial Training. The first five are ranked from 0 to 12, while Martial Training can go below 0 and up to 7. Your race grants your starting stats, based off of a racial template, as well as indicates which suits are Fortune Smiles and which are Fortune Frowns. In addition, race gives you skill options and your choices of Religion. The elves are a touch different from normal in that they are immortal, and no new elves have been born in 15 centuries...they also do not sleep, and cannot be harmed by disease or poison.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Next, you select your gender. This one will be a little controversial, as gender does alter your statistics, even if it&#039;s a minor change. It also provides another skill from a gender specific life: So for those of you sensitive about such things, women are both less hardy and are better cooks. Being a woman also grants you the first two possible Fortune Shines cards, Empress and Lovers.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Then you move to size, ranging from Tiny to Huge, with three steps in between. This is all relative, however, so a Huge dwarf is still very likely shorter than small orc. Size category alters your stats further, as well adding Fortune Shines and, if you&#039;re Tiny, another skill.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Age is ranked from Kid to Elderly, with appropriate modifiers along the way...the most noticeable being that your skills grow as your age grows.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Then we move to Birthright, which includes Eldest Child, Middle Child, Youngest Child, Seventh Child, Only Child, Orphan and Bastard. The Middle Child, for instance, gains no modifiers or skills, but does get four Fortune Shines cards. The Seventh Child is physically weaker, but has access to arcane powers.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Then you select your native environment, from City to Country to Nautical to Wilderness.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After that is Social Class, including Peasantry, Bourgeoise and Nobility.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The next big controversial point is going to be Religion...complete with a real world list from Catholicism to Judiasm to Moslem and Paganism. Elves have heavily converted to Catholicism, just so you know. Religion grants you Fate Twists, which are metagame abilities that allow you to screw with the Fate Deck.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
All the MAJOR choices are finished. Now you can increase one primary statistic that isn&#039;t Martial Training, follow the simple formulas to derive your secondary stats, determine your Skill Draws based off of the formula listed for each skill, then do a Fate Test and add the result to your Status to determine Wealth level. Pick a number of Martial Skills equal to your Martial Training (these resemble Feats from D&amp;amp;D 3rd Edition), and then draw your Fate Twists as listed under Religion. Every card you draw has some kind of special ability, such as Ill Omen which forces the Death card into the top 3 spots on top of the Fate Deck, Hunch allowing you to peek at the top card or Fat Chance, which takes any Minor Arcana cards of your choosing out of the boneyard (discard pile) and puts them back into the Fate deck.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Once this is done, use your Wealth level to pick your gear...if you try to use an item “above your class”, Fate will screw with you until you stop.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Your Fortune Smiles/Shines/Frowns/Weeps card are not set in stone...you can change them by diminishing your Fate Pool, as well as changing Fate Twists, etc.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Character creation seems pretty cool. I like Lifepath systems. In fact, I found a random Tarot Card generator, so I&#039;m going to go through character generation now:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Tanjlock Sarlon is an elf, living outside of Rome. He starts with Agility 7, Body 4, Heart 7, Perception 6, Status 7 and Martial Training 2.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
His Fortune Smiles is Swords, his Fortune Frowns are Cups, Pentacles and Wands.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We are gonna give him Literacy and Arcane Sense, I think.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
He&#039;s a male, so that boosts his Status up to 8. I think he&#039;ll take Swimming as his skill.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Going dead Joe Average on size, but he does gain Temperance, Judgement and World as Fortune Shines cards.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We skip Age and Birthright, but Tanjlock is a Wilderness sort. This raises is Heart to 8, Perception to 7 and lowers his Status back to 7. He gains High Priestess as a Fortune Shines, and the skills Survival, Fletching and Tracking.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Social Class? We&#039;re going Peasantry. This boosts his Body to 5, but lowers his Status to 5. He gains Strength, Hanged Man and Sun as Fortune Shines, plus Running, Construction, Climbing and Vocal Control to skills.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Tanjlock never converted to Catholicism, keeping to the Pagan ways. This gives him 1 Fate Twist, and he adds Culinary, Sixth Sense, Fey Magic and Wiccan Craft to his skills. I think I have inadvertantly made him a spellcaster.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We&#039;re going to boost his Body up to 6.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
His secondary attributes are Dodge: 7, Hand Attack 4, Ranged Attack 4, Movement 6, Initiative 7, Stealth 7, Hit Points 26.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For wealth, I get two draws (for being an elf). I have Ace of Wands and Knight of Swords. Since Swords is a Fortune Shines, I go with that and add +1 to my Status of 5, getting a 6. Double checking the chart, I find I&#039;m Middle Class. Not bad.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For my Martial Skill, I&#039;m taking Toughness, which lets me ignore Stun and Incapacitation on successful Heart checks...and since I have a Heart of 8, that&#039;s not shabby at all.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
My one Fate Twist is Magician, which gives me Premonition. This lets me look at the top 3 cards and discard 1, forcing the GM to shuffle those two and one other back on top of the deck. I can pick my Middle Class gear and I&#039;m off.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Yeah, that&#039;s kinda cool.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter two lays out all the skills, Martial and otherwise, in detail...while three goes into the Fate Twists. It&#039;s worth noting that while the game has a much larger skill list than I tend to like, I don&#039;t mind it here since your actual skill choices will be dictated by your character creation decisions...you do always have a choice, it&#039;s just a limited one based off of your selections. I think it works very well.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter four is gear, listing everything with a fairly basic block, including minimum Martial Skill, number of hands required, minimum Wealth level and damage. Also included in this chapter are armor, shields and animals, for those that like their wardogs and such.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter five is spells, and breaks magic down in types: Fey, Gypsy, Kabbalah, Wiccan and Witchcraft. Each type of magic has Basic, Advanced and Mastery spells, getting more and more powerful as you go. As noted above, Tanjlock has access to both Fey and Wiccan magic. This gives him some nice effects, such as Ancient Law which eliminates the damage dealing potential of metal weapons and the ability to control animals. Some spells require incantations, some just a word, some require an additional sacrifice. The draw required for each spell is clearly listed in it&#039;s description as well. Resurrection Magic is possible at a cost to both caster and subject, in the Master Wiccan list, though Witchcraft has a darkly perverted version that raises undead minions.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter six details four important cards that have additional effects on gameplay: Wheel of Fortune, Death, The Tower and The Fool. Death, for instance, when played to the table makes all attacks more lethal, until it has claimed a victim. Very nice touch.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter seven is Combat, which details the intricacies of using the Tarot cards for the combat system. NPCs always react in the middle of the PCs who had successes on initiative and those who failed on initiative. Fortune&#039;s Fool is a “player&#039;s perspective” game, which means that everything is done through them. NPC&#039;s don&#039;t attack, PC&#039;s dodge, for instance. The chapter (in fact, the whole book) is written very clearly, with several clearly laid out tables to aid you.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter eight talks about the world, breaking down the alternate history...such as the Persian orc Emperor Xerxes, who battled the Spartan dwarves. The Roman Empire was an elven empire, and shortly after the Crucifixion, they were struck childless. From there it moves to the setting&#039;s present, detailing the regions and countries and their ethnic make-ups, such as Bavaria being primarily dwarven versus Prussia&#039;s heavy orc population.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chapter nine is advice on running the game, such as what to put into the time period and what not to, noting that orcs and goblins should be treated like foreigners and not monsters, and stressing that the game is meant to be at least somewhat lethal. It also devotes a few paragraphs to player versus player conflict, since the game is written to assume that players will be acting in every action against an NPC, so player versus player will change the dynamic. The bestiary covers the basics of animals and monsters, namely description, Hit Points, Movement, Attack information, Defense and any Special Abilities. There isn&#039;t a ton of information in a monster&#039;s stat block, so it&#039;s incredibly easy to add a monster if you like.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A two page character sheet, followed by a relisting of every table in the book wrap it up, with a cheeky goblin-as-Mona Lisa picture.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you don&#039;t like orcs, dwarves and elves? Stay away. If you don&#039;t like gimmicks and fiddly bits? Stay away. That said, Fortune&#039;s Fool is a very clearly written, very affordable (especially if you already own a Tarot deck) fantasy RPG that does hit on a setting that you don&#039;t see overused in RPGs: Renaissance Europe. Probably the biggest flaw I see with the game is “What do you do with it?” I mean, there are some monsters roaming the lands, but it doesn&#039;t assume the same dungeon crawl mentality you find in most fantasy games, and there&#039;s not a lot of actual campaign advice in the rulebook, which is otherwise very excellent. The art in the game is very cute, with some classic, renaissance era paintings rejiggered to show fantasy races in their place (such as the aforementioned Goblin-as-Mona Lisa). If you&#039;re looking for something just a little bit different to play with, head over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pantheonpress.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.pantheonpress.com&lt;/a&gt; and order it...if the previous disclaimers didn&#039;t run you off, then it&#039;s at least worth the $20 for the black and white version or the $10 for the PDF. For me, I don&#039;t particularly care about the Renaissance period, but if I had a deck of Tarot cards in hand, I might be inclined to divorce the system from the setting and go for something a bit more traditional in my fantasy. In fact, these guys may have just convinced me to buy one.</content>

Apparently I review a lot of supers games these days, and the latest in that…                    </summary>

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Apparently I review a lot of supers games these days, and the latest in that field is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82573&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;Smallville RPG&lt;/a&gt;, newly released in PDF for $20 at RPGNow, and available in hardcopy at GenCon for $40.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I&#039;ll be honest...I&#039;m not a big fan of the show. I tried watching it in the early seasons, but got turned off by a mix of “Freak of the Week”, Tom Welling&#039;s one facial expression and how seemingly every episode ended with the same overwrought scene between Clark and Lana where she went on at length about how people can&#039;t keep secrets from one another and Clark, well, had his one facial expression. I sure did enjoy Lex and Lionel Luthor, though.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
That being said, it&#039;s not the license that brings me to the game, it&#039;s the system. &lt;i&gt;Smallville&lt;/i&gt; was released by Margaret Weis Productions, who are handily taking over the slow once occupied by Eden Studios as the cult license company, previously releasing &lt;i&gt;Serenity&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Supernatural&lt;/i&gt;. All of their games use their own in-house system known as Cortex, which ranks any abilities, perks and what have you in die types, and you roll the relevant dice together. In &lt;i&gt;Smallville&lt;/i&gt;, you virtually always roll three dice (unless you spend Plot Points to roll more), taking the highest two results and adding them together.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
One of the major areas where &lt;i&gt;Smallville&lt;/i&gt; departs from the other Cortex games is that your characters don&#039;t have ability scores in the classic sense. Instead, they have Values: Duty, Glory, Justice, Love, Power and Truth. What&#039;s more, each Drive is further defined with a sentence. Clark Kent, for example, believes that Power Corrupts, and ranks that Drive with d4. Zod, on the other hand, ranks it at a d10 with the tag on sentence “Kneel before Zod!” Again, every character has the six Values, ranked from d4 to d12, and every character has a sentence describing their connection to the Values.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The next thing they are ranked on are Relationships...which includes relationships with the other PCs (PCs are called “Leads”), as well as major NPCs (Features) and minor NPCs (Extras). Relationships can grow and change over the course of the game, getting stronger, weaker or even changing dramatically (rivals slowly becoming friends, or lovers drifting apart). Just as with Values, every Relationship is ranked with a die type and a descriptive sentence.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Distinctions are descriptive qualities, often positive and negative, that are triggered with Plot Points, or grant Plot Points. The negatives are often choosing to do something in character, but detrimental, in exchange for a Plot Point. Lionel Luthor&#039;s Family Reputation allows him to gain a Plot Point and give his opposition a d6 whenever his reputation precedes him, or he can add a d6 to the GM&#039;s (Watchtower&#039;s) “Trouble Pool” (dice the Watchtower uses to add opposition to a situation, beginning with 2d6 and changing over time) in exchange for a “get out of jail free card”, that is, buying his way out of a sticky situation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Abilities are things like superpowers, and Smallville provides a good number of them, plenty enough to add in your own. As it&#039;s not a heavily “balanced” system, there&#039;s not nearly as much tinkering involved in inserting new Abilities (or Distinctions, for that matter). You can use the die type of Abilities for relevant rolls, or spend Plot Points to do amazing stunts.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Gear is a lot like Abilities, just mainly for the non-powered types.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Lastly are Resources, such as Extras and Locations, which can be tapped up to twice in an Episode for aid. You can even tap someone else&#039;s Resources...you just have to pay them a Plot Point for taking away their Resource.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Also, as mentioned, Leads have Plot Points which are used to trigger Abilities, call in Resources, roll extra dice, include extra dice in your final result (instead of just the two highest), tag a Useful Aspect in a scene that gives you an extra d6 to call on in the scene, or add a Relationship on the spot. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For someone who is generally a pretty traditional gamer, like me, there are a lot of concepts and philosophies in Smallville that confound me a bit, such as Relationship Maps, Stress Pools, and so forth. Character generation, in fact, is a group session that also entails basically creating the world, because each player adds important NPCs and Locations to the game as they build up their characters. Luckily, the book is filled with examples, including a step by step walkthrough of character generation, complete with diagrams of the Relationship Map. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Smallville uses a Lifepath system called Pathways, and you build your characters in steps, starting with Origin (Rich, Ordinary, Gifted, Strange and Alien/Metahuman) which guides you on the initial adjustments to your characters. From there, each Origin has an “exit” to three of five Youth options: Jock, Average, Geek, Outsider and Paragon. From Youth you get your Focus options: Money, Life, Status, Technology and Paranormal, which in turn opens your Road: Risky, Straight and Narrow, Lofty, Underground and Ethical. This all sets up your Life-Changing Event, be it Advancement, Tragedy, Power Manifestation, First Contact and Destiny. These are the minimum steps to create “rookie” characters. Throughout this, the Pathways system is also giving you instructions on modifying the Relationship Map, so it is growing and changing as the character generation progresses and the game world is taking shape.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you choose to continue After The Event, you get to move through the steps of Priority, Modus Operandi, Motivation and Identity...and then, if everyone really wants to keep on moving, the book provides handy guidelines on advancing even further, to have some truly seasoned characters.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This would all really throw me except, as mentioned, they use excellent examples in the book. Though the Pathways system encourages you to follow certain Paths, the book does mention that it is perfectly viable to skip around a bit, if it&#039;s really suitable for your character concept.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Once this is all finished (using the Season 9 Leads of Clark, Chloe, Oliver, Lois, Tess and Zod), handy character sheets are provided for each Lead, matching the example just used.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Lots of advice is provided for scene framing, as well as Contests (complete with examples). If you&#039;re losing a Contest, you can Give In and let the winning side get what they wanted from the Contest or you can run the risk of taking Stress (and possibly becoming Stressed Out). There are five types of Stress (Afraid, Angry, Exhausted, Injured and Insecure), and the types of Stress can be influenced by certain Distinctions and Abilities. If a Lead becomes Stressed Out, they gain a Plot Point, are basically removed from a Scene, and step all their Stress back one step. Giving In is not without risks, though. If you&#039;ve rolled any dice, then Giving In costs you a Plot Point, either straight up, or gained by lowering one of your Values or Relationships.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
One area I would have appreciated an example for is Advancement, as you use your Growth Pool (which includes healed Stress, or dice from Values that you have challenged through the course of the episode) to roll against the Watchtower to try to boost Relationships, Resources, Abilities, Gear and Distinctions. I think I&#039;ve got it now, but it took a few re-readings. This makes for an interesting game, too, as it basically forces you to fail in order to improve your character.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Some good guidelines are given for making Episodes, starting by making an Episode Map with your leads, pinpointing Relationships to highlight and then finding Wedges (adversaries, generally) to provide conflict for them.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A whole chapter is also devoted to online play, although that one veers a bit into pretentiousness, in my opinion, and that&#039;s not a good thing. (Asking for writing samples? Really?)&lt;br/&gt;
The remainder of the book is just an in-depth dissection of everything that makes up your characters and how they are used in play, &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A massive list of Distinctions are present, as well as useful guidelines on making your own Distinctions to fill in any blanks you might have. The same is done with both Abilities and Gear.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Resources are the big exception to the rules, as they are rated as 2dWhatever, and each have a couple of tags, which basically indicate how they are used by the Leads. For instance, Lex Luther has LuthorCorp Security with (Security, Retrievals) at 2d6...he can call them in and add their D6 to a die roll when trying to locate Lana, who has gone missing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Every major (and a lot of minor) characters are included, with the notable exception of Pete Ross (who will surely show up in the High School Yearbook), full statted out for use as you see fit. This section is one of the few parts that doesn&#039;t use screencaps, instead using art pieces that I wasn&#039;t a big fan of. Among the heroes and villains present include Doomsday, John Jones (Martian Manhunter), Amanda Waller, Doctor Fate and Lex Luthor himself. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The game material concludes with an extensive listing of locations from the TV show, but the book isn&#039;t done yet as it provides extensive overviews of the first seven seasons, followed by episode breakdowns of seasons eight and nine.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The book is gorgeous, laid out in red and blue, with tons of screencaps from the show and it is just filled full of Smallville Stuff. I mean, I quit even trying to follow the show a couple of seasons in and I feel comfortable about running something in canon based off of the book. Combine that with the helpful guidelines to go along with the extensive examples of Abilities and Distinctions and they give you everything you need to expand the game as you see fit. I also have to applaud the MWP crew: Smallville Season 9 ended in May....this book released at the end of July...and is up to date from the end of Season 9. From my experience in following licensed RPGs, that is some really impressive stuff and speaks to the level of cooperation MWP had from someone on the Smallville crew.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Tremendous game with top notch production values...the best release I&#039;ve seen from MWP yet and the best licensed DC RPG I&#039;ve read, hands down.</content>

So Adamant Entertainment recently released the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=81475&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975&quot;&gt;ICONS&lt;/a&gt; RPG, a superhero RPG written by Steve Kenson and inspired in no small part by the old Marvel Classic roleplaying game. It&#039;s a very rules lite RPG, (almost too lite for my tastes in some places) but is still pretty cool. It even has random character generation, which has inspired more than a few ideas for me that are likely to wind up in comic books down the line. That said, I got the bright idea to write up the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in ICONS, inspired partly by the fact that my kids are HUGE fans of the Turtles. My ICONS Turtleverse is taken from the bits of each Turtleverse I like best, and so the write-ups are kind of a hybrid of the various Turtles incarnations.&lt;br /&gt;

Leonardo is the leader of the Turtles, the most spiritual as well as being the strongest fighter. His Qualities are pretty self explanatory, but his Challenges include a healthy fear of snakes, constant personality clashes with Raphael, a somewhat naive outlook on other beings and a tendency to hold himself to such exacting standards that it not only impacts him, but his brothers when they fail to live up to Leonardo&#039;s lofty ideals...though Leonardo himself never actually holds that against his siblings.&lt;br /&gt;

The brainiac of the Turtles, Donatello loves tinkering with machines, computers, you name it. At home with a motherboard or a van engine, he relishes the opportunity to work with his hands. Given a few minutes and some materials, he has a knack for bashing together all kinds of wacky inventions, though they sometimes go awry. The second in command of the Turtles due to a maturity level second only to Leo&#039;s, Don is the quietest but steadiest Turtle. Don is the least aggressive of the Turtles. That&#039;s not saying he WON&#039;T fight, especially if his family is in danger, just that he will work harder to avoid conflict in any situation and is harder to move to action than any of his brothers. He also has a hard time relating to people, not really understanding human cultures the same way his brothers (especially Michelangelo) do. Also, as mentioned, his devices often go on the fritz at the worst possible time.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Michelangelo is pure, energetic spirit among the Turtles. The most outgoing of the brothers, he is always the one to look on the brighter side of a situation, or reach out to a stranger in need...no matter how strange, such as in the case of the mutated crocodile Leatherhead. His enthusiasm can be infectious, to the point that he can even make Raphael crack a smile. While he is the least skilled fighter of the Turtles, he is also the most athletic as well as being the most poetic. Michelangelo, in addition to being a warrior, is also an author in his free time. However, he is much less disciplined than his brothers, which can grate on them, and his constant jokes can even make Splinter and Donatello snap at him. Michelangelo also does less than the others because he is almost &quot;babied&#039; by them, being treated as less capable than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Bullheaded to the very end, Raphael often clashes with his brothers, ESPECIALLY Leonardo. He doesn&#039;t follow orders well, and it irks him to no end that Leonardo has Donatello as his second in command and Splinter agrees with that. Raphael is ALMOST as good as Leonardo...his biggest problem being his temper, which can cause him to make mistakes or say and do things he regrets later. Though he sometimes moonlights as The Nightwatcher, which gives him the freedom that being a member of the Turtles doesn&#039;t, it is something he has to keep secret because the other Turtles, especially Donatello, would not approve of his methods. All that said, Raphael is fiercely loyal to his brothers, Michelangelo most of all, and would not hesitate to give his life to save them. He is more than a little creeped out by insects, though.&lt;br /&gt;

Disclaimer: I consider Tim Kirk to be a friend of mine. That said, he and I both know we don&#039;t necessarily agree on all things regarding game design. However, Tim trusts me to give him a fair review and I&#039;ll do that. It&#039;s all I&#039;ve ever tried to do with these things. Honestly, if anything, I&#039;m probably being a tad rougher in some areas because of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Silverlion Studios just released their second RPG, &lt;i&gt;High Valor&lt;/i&gt;, which is a new fantasy RPG designed for heroic fantasy role-playing. The author states up front that he&#039;s not trying to reinvent the wheel, just provide an alternative for those who aren&#039;t pleased with their current choice of fantasy role-playing, or even those who just want to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;High Valor&lt;/i&gt; was just released on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82385&amp;amp;affiliate_id=15975%20&quot;&gt;RPG.now&lt;/a&gt; for $12.95 in PDF format. The PDF not only has a table of contents and index, but is fully bookmarked and searchable for easy reference. The book was released in black and white, but this was a thematic choice on the part of the designer, and honestly I really think it works. Similar to how most of the supplements for the &lt;i&gt;Midnight&lt;/i&gt; game line were all in black and white, it helps enhance the feel rather than take away from it. I do know the author just received a print copy of the book, so I imagine a print release is also on the horizon, though I don&#039;t have those details at the time of this review.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
High Valor&lt;/i&gt; hits a few of my pet peeves right off the bat, in that it includes dwarves and elves, but renames them Dvegr and Sidda, respectively. I don&#039;t mind dwarves and elves being in the game, but I&#039;d just prefer them be called dwarves and elves. The second pet peeve is that PCs are largely defined by traits and challenges, which are player defined (not unlike FATE or &lt;i&gt;Over the Edge&lt;/i&gt;). This one is alleviated, however, by a LARGE list of examples from various kinds of traits, rather than just a couple of examples to choose from. The third thing that gave me an eye twitch was when I got the bestiary: Monsters and adversaries are pure description with a challenge score. That is, say, a troll is a Heroic challenge, and that sets the difficulty for defeating a troll outright. You can try to wear it down by making less difficult actions and thus taking less risk, however. The final thing isn&#039;t a pet peeve per se, but High Valor is a “players roll” system, meaning that, well, players roll dice and the GM doesn&#039;t. I don&#039;t have a problem with this, but in my experience this always leads to a few oddities in the system and I&#039;ve picked up the odd place in the magic system where this might be the case.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From a design standpoint, there are a few places in the book where font selections made the text a little more difficult to read. The author said this was meant to emulate a “handwriting” type of feel, and that would have been fine if those sections were just flavor text, but actual game information is in there, and that makes it disconcerting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That said, those are my complaints.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;High Valor&lt;/i&gt; is set in a world called Aiea, which is nearing the end of their Dark Ages when the Black Gate falls and the demonic Fane Lords return. Thus, the time is ripe for heroes to rise and protect the world from the Fane Lords and their minions. The setting is detailed, but not heavily so. In fact, the timeline is left with blank spots for the GM to fill in their own events to flesh out the world. The author provides details like coinage, verbage and the like to help give the world its identity, but there is meticulously detailing of every major NPC like you might find in a lot of fantasy settings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Character creation goes in steps and is largely freeform. First, pick you concept and then your kinship. Kinship is equivalent to race in your typical fantasy game and includes the Dvegr and Sidda, as well as Humans, the magic-twisted Sidhain (still kinda human, just...different) and Fomoradgh, the animalistic former footsoldiers of The Fane Lords who have decided to fight their former masters. Every kinship has an inherent trait and challenge or, in the case of the Sidhain, a list of traits or challenges to choose from. After that, you pick background traits keyed to being a member of your kinship. From there, select a profession and traits related to that and then three open traits for fleshing out. Traits add to your die rolls where applicable and are ranked from Lesser (+2) up to Mythic (+10). The challenge scale works on a similar scale of Lesser (8) to Mythic (28). Character generation gives you the option in places of taking, say, fewer traits at a higher level, or more traits at a lower level.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once your traits are complete, you have 5 dice to distribute among your FEAT Pools, which are Valor, Will and Faith. Each starts off at 1, so you get that freebie. Valor is generally used for physical type stuff, Will for mental type stuff (including magic) and Faith can be used to invoked divine miracles as well as ward off dark forces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everything you do involves rolling from those pools and applying relevant traits. You take the highest die and add your traits. HOWEVER, for every “10” that you roll, you keep it AND add the next highest die. So if you roll four dice and get 3, 5, 6 and 9, you take the 9 and add the two highest relevant traits. Had you rolled 3, 5, 6 and 10, you get the 10 and the 6 plus the traits! You must roll higher than the target number to succeed. If you roll equal to it, that&#039;s a stalemate and the GM or the player can take a minor setback for the character they have involved in the conflict in order to take the upperhand, or they can call that action a draw and move on to the next action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When things are desperate, you can use other pools to bolster an active one. Say you are locked in a physical struggle with a giant and you think your physical Valor will not be enough, you can borrow a die from your Will pool to bolster yourself for the struggle. Or, say, a dark force is trying to corrupt you and your Will is fading...so you invoke a Prayer and add Faith to your pool. The downside is that doing so diminishes the pool you borrowed from for an entire scene. The only limits are that you cannot use Faith to bolster magic and you cannot Will miracles into existence. However, your allied can lend you dice and they have no limitations on how they do that...literally, your allies can will you to greater heights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stakes for failure are based off of the difficulty of the action. If something is of a Lesser difficulty, there shouldn&#039;t be any danger of death. However, a Mythic challenge is very, very harrowing and so on. When faced with a challenge that is just too overwhelming, with the GM&#039;s (or “Teller&#039;s”) discretion you can take smaller, less difficult actions to whittle the challenge down and increase your chances of success. I definitely think this is something that&#039;ll take some getting used to for myself and my players, but could be very cool regardless.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just about everything in the game is a Trait. If you have a sword, but not a Sword trait, you roll Valor. If you have your Father&#039;s Battle-Worn Blade (+4), you roll Valor +4. Since you can add two relevant traits to an action, if you have your Father&#039;s Battle-Worn Blade (+4) and Swordsman (+2), roll your Valor +6.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enchanted items work the same way, and a sample of Items of Power are included in the book, as well as tips on converting existing equipment to Items of Power, something I&#039;ve always loved. Don&#039;t get me wrong...it&#039;s cool finding a Vorpal Weapon +3....but it&#039;s a LOT cooler when you plunge your sword into a demon&#039;s fiery heart and from that day forward your blade is covered in glowing veins that are poison to those of demonic blood, am I right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As noted above, there are two kinds of metaphysics in the game: Faith and Magic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Faith has smaller applications, such as Blessings. They can be used to lay a protective blessing on children, ward off demons for a day and so forth. Minor miracles are the next step, and some of the examples supplied include gusts of wind knocking arrows aside or the sun emerging from the clouds to blind a foe. Major miracles can summon Angelic aid, raise the dead and open sinkholes under enemies. Note, however, that miracles can have setbacks and they can be intense, such as drawing the attention of evil forces or even encouraging the High Power to call the miracle invoker home...(death, basically).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Magic is divided into Low and High magic, which is not unlike the Blessings/Miracles division. Low magic are very minor effects, that can be reasonably denied. They generally add, at best, a +2 to an action like a Lesser Trait. High Magic, on the other hand, can do wondrous things, but requires relevant skills to perform and can have much greater consequences. In fact, every use of High magic WILL have setbacks...though the caster, with time, preparation and ritual can reduce the level of setback. The simplest is Shadowplay, which is creating a short rhyme for the spell, said out loud, and reduces the setback level by 1 step. No matter how much the caster prepares, though, they cannot eliminate the setbacks altogether.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using a similar set-up to the Faith and Magic system, the book also details a list of herbs, poisons and plants that can be used to provide a variety of traits, such as mandrake, which can be used to both knock a person unconscious or kill them, the furze tree, which acts as a barrier against trolls and can be burnt to ward off all evil, and coltsfoot, used specifically to heal horses and their riders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
High Valor&lt;/i&gt; uses an interesting advancement system, in which you track your Triumphs and Dooms. These are your major successes and failures. Once you have accumulated ten of them, you can advance your character, either by improving a Trait, adding a die to a pool, adding a new trait or removing a challenge. The key in each is significance. Beating up a shopkeeper and taking their money? Not impressive. Rallying the impoverished town together to wage war against the demon-influenced overlord and overthrowing his reign of oppression? Much better. And even if that attempt fails, the town is crushed and you&#039;re left for dead, that&#039;s still gonna fall under a Doom. The key is to think Big.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cover is very indicative to what &lt;i&gt;High Valor&lt;/i&gt; is all about: A lone warrior, spear in hand, standing over fallen foes while another group of enemies rushes him and the demonic head of a Fane Lord appears overhead. The setting included into the book has dark forces brewing, but unlike a &lt;i&gt;Midnight&lt;/i&gt; or a &lt;i&gt;Ravenloft&lt;/i&gt;, there is no sense that heroes will be crushed for fighting evil. Quite the opposite, in fact...great evil is there to allow the PCs to rise up and BE heroes. That&#039;s how I like my fantasy. Heck, that&#039;s how I like my games, period: Dark, but not hopeless. There must be a little spark that can be fanned into a glorious flame, and for the misgivings I laid out at the beginning of this review, that is exactly what &lt;i&gt;High Valor&lt;/i&gt; provides.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;High Valor&lt;/i&gt; is designed to provide the kind of fantasy adventure I wanted from &lt;i&gt;Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 2nd Edition&lt;/i&gt;, but never quite found because so much of the system was still geared towards killing things and taking its stuff. High Valor provides a vehicle for that kind of epic, storytelling adventure while still keeping the “game” part of it present.</content>

&lt;i&gt;Resolute Supers 2nd Edition&lt;/i&gt; is an interesting small-press game supers released by Michael T. Desing and Teddy Bear Press, clocking in at a whopping 17 pages (yes, seventeen) and going for $2 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=81467&quot;&gt;RPGnow.com&lt;/a&gt;. It&#039;s not exactly a “rules lite” RPG...it&#039;s really seventeen pages jammed pretty full of material. The format is a fully searchable PDF with three text columns in landscape format per page. There isn&#039;t very much art, which may be a good thing as 1) there&#039;s very little filler and 2) honestly, the art isn&#039;t very good. It&#039;s cartoony but not in a good or evocative way (especially as the setting doesn&#039;t feel very cartoony).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The setting reminds me a bit of Pinnacle&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Necessary Evil&lt;/i&gt;, both of which are Supers vs Aliens settings, although &lt;i&gt;Necessary Evil&lt;/i&gt; is pretty explicitly supervillains versus aliens. The book opens with a 15 year timeline of the world, from the arrival of the alien Emissary who unlocked superpowered potential in people in preparation for the arrival of the Messari – a race of alien conquerors. The timeline is painted in broad strokes, focusing on the two attempted invasions by the Messari and the world&#039;s reactions to them, before bringing us to the “now”, where the world is preparing for the likelihood of a third invasion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The mechanics are simple enough: You roll 2d6 and add your relevant Ability to it. Everything in the game is rated from -1 to +13 and applied as a modifier. Successes are rated as as multiples if the resisting score (i.e. if the resisting ability is +5, then one success is 5-9, two successes is 10-14, etc). It&#039;s probably not the MOST intuitive, but I bet it&#039;d only take a couple of sessions to get used to. If there is no active ability resisting an action, apply a “static 7” as the difficulty. The writing clarity wasn&#039;t the best here, as in the examples in the final paragraph I didn&#039;t catch that the static 7 was being applied until I stopped and did the math.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The bulk of character generation is on page three, and is a level-based point buy (not wholly unlike power levels in &lt;i&gt;Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds&lt;/i&gt;). Norms are built on 0-9 points, while super powerful movers and shakers clock in at 100+ points with several levels in between. Once the point level is set, the players pick one of the factions (which include government operative hero types, mutants thinking the end is near, pariahs living on the fringes of society and outsiders who just don&#039;t fit anywhere else). Pick your name and purpose, then spend your points. There is no separation between ability scores and powers...they are all just Abilities. A handy chart along the bottom of the page helps with the bean counting. You can also “focus” abilities, boosting it&#039;s effectiveness in one area while diminishing its effectiveness in all other areas (the example listed in the book is the Science Ability, specializing in a field at the expense of the other uses).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next three pages are filled with Abilities, which cover a lot of ground and should provide ample inspiration if you want to do something that isn&#039;t covered. Abilities cover pretty much everything in the game, from contacts to skills to superpowers...everything is covered under one unified mechanic. There&#039;s even an Omni-Power that has examples covering trick archers, magic and Green Lantern-ish light powers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can take limitations that provide extra bonus points, which should be kicked in about once a session. Advancement is handled with Hero Points, which you get for doing good deeds and can either be cashed in for Character Points or Fate Points.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fate Points let you recover wounds, boost die rolls (adding an additional 2D to the roll) and take extra turns in the middle of a combat round. In additional to gaining Fate Points by trading in Hero Points, you get your level in Fate Points at the beginning of each issue. This is kind of an odd change from supers games, as mechanics like these are usually used to balance, say, Captain America and Thor or Batman and Superman. However, in Resolute this is going to make your powerful beings more powerful. It&#039;s not a huge problem in and of itself, but it definitely isn&#039;t going to accommodate, say, Plastic Man and Green Lantern teaming up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Group Points are gained by a team to purchase things like group vehicles, with promises of rules for bases coming in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Combat takes up another three pages. Initiative is 2D versus a static number of 5, each success granting a turn in each round. In addition, each round has a Preparation phase, which grants you chance to take on free action that isn&#039;t an attack, before moving into the Resolution phase where everyone gets to take their turns in order starting from the highest rolls on down. One sidebar covers found weapons, such as the Thing tearing out a light pole and using it, which gives a bonus to damage while degrading with every use.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ability Synergy rules are simple guidelines for using different abilities to supplement certain actions, like using Flame Control to set your fist on fire before punching someone, or combining Speed and Fighting to charge opponents. You can fight into negative wounds, at which point you have to start rolling Stamina to keep from passing out. Mook rules are present, allowing heroes to mow through legions of faceless baddies. The rule is simple: You can attack a number of mooks equal to the rating of the ability you&#039;re using. With Energy Projection +6, you can blast six mooks at once. The caveat is that you cannot attack mooks AND named foes at the same time...one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gang up rules are included (to give mooks a chance), as well as a list of special situations...you know the stuff: falling, fighting in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A nice optional rule is “Exchanging Wounds”, which lets you trade wounds for bonus effects if you hit for 2 or more wounds. Some options include disarming foes, stunning foes, knocking foes back or trying to force foes to draw their attentions on you (very useful if you&#039;re trying to defend an innocent bystander targeted by a deranged killer, or drawing a villain away from a downed comrade). The chapter ends with a sample her, The Emissary, the very being that started it all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next chapter is the GM section, which starts with some bog standard GM advice that you&#039;ve read in most RPGs to this point. It then gets into more specific advice, such as noting that heroes cannot repeat a failed action against a static resistance in the same scene, as well as tips on using degrees of success when heroes are performing actions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The GM section provides four methods for die rolls, from rolling everything to rolling only active dice (all resistances use Static 7), to Only Players Roll to Mix-and-Match, such as players rolling against mooks, but archvillains getting active dice on their actions and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, most helpfully, the author includes guidelines for balancing encounters, which can be very helpful at least at first, so you don&#039;t accidentally wipe out your party.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is probably the least impressive section of the book, honestly...like I said, a lot of this is stuff you&#039;ve read in every other GM section...but things like the encounter balancing are very nice and useful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chapter 7 is a one page guide to adventures on the earth, complete with a decent random roll adventure generator that you can use in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first two appendices fit on one page, the first being stat blocks for common mooks, and animals, as well as four supers archetypes. The second appendix is a handful of vehicles that you can use as is, or as guidelines for making more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book ends with an introductory adventure that starts with the PCs waking up in a lab with no memory about how they got there, and ends with a couple of options depending on where the players and GM may want to take it. Pretty basic stuff, but a decent launching point, especially if you have nothing better in mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s 17 pages for $2 and not a lot of filler. The GM section had some extraneous material that could have been removed, especially for a couple of more examples. The adventure isn&#039;t anything special, either...but there is a full game packed into these 17 pages, with a surprising amount of options.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first supplement, a 9 page Referee&#039;s Guide is already out (I&#039;ll likely be covering this soon as well) selling for $1 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=81934&quot;&gt;RPGnow&lt;/a&gt;, and is the model for the company ($1-$2 products, text heavy, jammed with material).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#039;s a pretty cool game in here, with some very nice options. A couple of parts should be clearer, but the author is working on a document to clarify some points, and there is plenty of room to expand the game world, expand on the aliens (who are largely untouched in the main book, due to the fact that people are anticipating the third invasion, not in the middle of one).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Very good stuff...good bang for the buck. Check it out.</content>
