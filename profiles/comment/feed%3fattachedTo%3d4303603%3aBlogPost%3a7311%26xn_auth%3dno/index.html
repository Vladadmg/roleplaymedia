Game seems cool, atmosphere seems like a lot of fun, system seems like it could use a re-write.

Then once you&#039;ve learned that monsters can be killed with guns and explosions, the game punishes you for learning what it just taught you by throwing a monster that can&#039;t be killed with guns and explosions at you. Then you come to the internet and fans of the game insist that the first set of monsters don&#039;t exist at all and you should have known better. Well la dee dah.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#039;s not to say there aren&#039;t some great things about it. It&#039;s fast and intuitive and written with a great deal of love for the genre. The people involved have not just kept the Cthulhu torch burning, but burned down the whole damn forest. But as a system, you&#039;re right. It has a lot of problems that could be solved if anyone would ever let the game change. This the aforementioned fans will not permit.                    </content>

I am mostly at odds with the character creation and advancement having a lack of customization and options.

The fact of the matter is if I say I don&#039;t like a system, it&#039;s not that surprising, as I noted earlier in the blog. The fact that I like the subject matter of CoC so much is a boon for the game in my opinion, and as a mentioned, the writing is fantastic, so I&#039;m all in for the most part. I just kind of react poorly when everyone bombards me about there CoC fanaticism. I guess I did choose my words poorly though, I think once I try it, I&#039;ll be a fan.                    </content>

@Tim: I have looked into Don&#039;t Rest my Head, I&#039;m interested, but haven&#039;t gotten a chance to read or play it. I&#039;ve played Dread and I like it a lot, in fact I&#039;m planning to run a dread game off of the quick start rules in a couple weeks, but I&#039;m looking for a more campaign oriented game at the moment. I&#039;ve never heard of My Life with Master, but I&#039;ll look into it. Thanks for the heads up on those!                    </summary>

The REAL fight in Call of Cthulhu is against the omnipresent threat of insanity brought about by the investigators&#039; ever increasing knowledge of Things Man Was Not Meant To Know. That said, there is occasionally a right time for physical confrontation, which is why stats are presented.&lt;br /&gt;

If you want or need an experienced player. let me know. I&#039;m interested.&lt;br /&gt;
