                        Love this advice. I&#039;m looking into both POD and PDF, so for me, it&#039;s not doing the same thing twice. I already have to make the PDF for POD, so why not spend some time giving the PDF version some features and whatnot? Yes, it&#039;s more work, but from reading the comments below, it appears that customers like PDFs with some semblance of &quot;electronicness&quot;. That should translate into more sales and buzz, but as is the case in any industry, who really knows?                    </summary>

The realities of sales in our industry is that, so far, it has not made any financial sense to pursue dual forms of a product; usually the one product is morphed into however many forms it can in order to make it profitable.

&lt;br /&gt;
Sales data so far shows that customers for the most part do only want an e-version of the book. The best way to make sure that primarily-electronic products are produced is to (a) let publishers know you want them and (b) support financially those experiments along the way that show steps in the right direction.                    </content>
