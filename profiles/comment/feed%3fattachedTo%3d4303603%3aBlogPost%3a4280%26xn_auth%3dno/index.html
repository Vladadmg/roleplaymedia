What that something else is will attract others of like minds, others will drift away. There&#039;s a LOT to hold our attention on the Net these days and not much time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One more note on the GMs vs players listing: I, for one, debated whether or not to list myself as a GM, which in the past I&#039;ve done til my eyes bleed. I didn&#039;t list myself that way because right now I have zero interest in doing it.                    </content>

&lt;br /&gt;
What does this tell us?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, for one thing, as you note, it VERY STRONGLY supports the alpha gamer theory. If, out of a gaming group of six, only one person GMs, that means that this network&#039;s representation (with 228 out of 289 GMing) is very heavily skewed towards the GMs. GMs are usually the most enthusiast of tabletop roleplayers, so it makes sense that they are the most engaged in the online community.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For better or for worse, this also means that players are very underrepresented here - the vast majority of opinions and experiences shared on this network are going to be from the perspective of those who spend at least some of their time behind the GM&#039;s screen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this massive skew, pretty much no statistic you see here is going to be generalizable to the tabletop community as a whole.                    </content>
