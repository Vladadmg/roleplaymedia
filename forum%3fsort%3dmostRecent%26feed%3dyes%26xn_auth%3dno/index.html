                        &lt;p&gt;First, what you want to hear: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://roleplaymedia.net/&quot;&gt;Role Play Media Network&lt;/a&gt; will survive the July 20th Ning-pocalypse intact. The only changes we intend to make are the ones Ning might require for migration to their paid hosting scheme. Aside from that, carry on as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d like to apologize for keeping everyone in suspense about this, but we didn&#039;t know ourselves until this morning. RPMN is an asset of UncleBear Media LLC. Because we&#039;re just…&lt;/p&gt;                    </summary>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d like to apologize for keeping everyone in suspense about this, but we didn&#039;t know ourselves until this morning. RPMN is an asset of UncleBear Media LLC. Because we&#039;re just starting up and we have our fingers in so many pies, from RPG publishing to producing an indie film to possibly toy manufacturing (is that not public information yet? Oops.), our focus is understandably on stuff that makes money. The Ning bombshell blew a hole in our production schedule; we have plans for RPMN, but &lt;i&gt;not just yet&lt;/i&gt;. We discussed ways to monetize it, but we&#039;re not happy with those. I, personally, am not happy with those. I want it to be its own thing, not an UncleBear house organ. We could sell more advertising, there are various paid services we could add, we could beg for donations, but in the end we&#039;re just going to underwrite it for now and figure out ways to make it financially self-sustaining later. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do want to help, what the Role Play Media Network really needs is fresh meat for the Brute Squad. We need more moderators to approve members and bring the banhammer down on spammers. The automated anti-spam tools work great, mind you, but clever people manager to get around it from time to time and need to be dealt with. There&#039;s a thread on the RPMN forum where we&#039;re recruiting. If you want to chip in a few bucks for costs, there&#039;s also a donation tab, but we&#039;re not actively begging for cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the future... stay tuned. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </content>

                        I have an idea about a way to do a blog aggregator. Just an idea, I&#039;ll let the more technically knowledgeable people fact check this for viability.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Google Alerts (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/alerts&quot;&gt;http://www.google.com/alerts&lt;/a&gt;) can be set up to search blogs for keywords, and send you alerts by email, in Google Reader, or via an RSS feed. It gives you code for an RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People who want to have blog posts appear on The Feed add the keyword to the blog post somehow, so Google picks up…                    </summary>

&lt;br /&gt;
People who want to have blog posts appear on The Feed add the keyword to the blog post somehow, so Google picks up on it. It has to be a unique keyword. I suggest &quot;rpmnfeed&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People who want to host the feed can just paste in the RSS code on a web page. Then The Feed will be available in multiple places. Or, you can receive the feed in any way Google Alerts serves it up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the event of spammers, we change the keyword.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No hosting required. No moderation required. It&#039;s distributed and open. And it should be relatively simple to execute... if it works.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, I need to find Java or Flash RSS code that works on a Ning page. Ning&#039;s native RSS limits the number of articles served.                    </content>

I would like members to design their own, and post them in this thread for others to use. Free-for-all. Nothing official.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m getting the specs (sizes, pixels, etc) to add a logo to the header and will post them when I do. Folks can post those here, too, and I&#039;ll pick the ones I like and use them (with attribution).                    </content>

                        I own the domain name. I run the site, and i make up the rules, although if you read the various forum threads, those are pretty loose guidelines at this point. The Brute Squad (admins) are all volunteers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The domain name cost me under $10.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hosting, which really means pointing the domain name to Ning.com, costs $4.95 a month. That gives me 10GB of storage and 100GB of bandwidth. That&#039;s why I ask people to link to link to or embed media.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the site goes over, it costs and additional $9.95…                    </summary>

&lt;br /&gt;
If the site goes over, it costs and additional $9.95 per month for each additional 10GB of storage and 100GB of bandwidth. If needed, I&#039;ll ask for donations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These costs are low because the host gets any and all revenue from the Google ads to the right. I can make those ads go away for $24.95 a month -- if you want to donate to do that, drop money in my PayPal account (webmaster at unclebear d0t com).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The costs are also low because Ning keeps that &quot;create your own&quot; bar at that top. If that annoys you, that costs $24.95 per month to make it go away. You can drop money in my PayPal account for that, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I added the RPGNow and Amazon banners, hoping affiliate programs will offset the minimal costs. If they generate more than $5 a month/$10 a year, I&#039;ll kill the google ads and the ning bar. Alternately, I&#039;ll sell you those banner ads, $35 a month for the one above the fold, $25 a month for the one below the fold. I&#039;ll use the money for hosting, removing the Google ads and removing the Ning bar, in that order.                    </content>

                        So here&#039;s the thing: if you&#039;re a blogger who writes about stuff other than roleplaying games, you might want to set up an RSS feed that only pulls RPG posts, and use that feed for your profile page here. But if you don&#039;t, neither I nor the Brute Squad will stop you. If you use the build-in blog function to start a non-RPG blog here, neither I nor the Brute Squad will stop you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here&#039;s why: If people don&#039;t want to read about your love life, your job, your car troubles, or other non-RPG stuff,…                    </summary>

Here&#039;s why: If people don&#039;t want to read about your love life, your job, your car troubles, or other non-RPG stuff, they&#039;ll stop hitting your profile page. You won&#039;t end up on the front page as a favorite member, and your blog won&#039;t hit the front page, either. It&#039;ll all stay tucked away on your profile page, not bothering anyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, the forum is a slightly different matter. I haven&#039;t created an &quot;off-topic&quot; forum, but I will if people want it. I&#039;d prefer not to. If you want to sell your car, grouse about school, or those sorts of things, do it on your blog, not on the forum. Best case scenario, people will ignore the forum thread and it will simple drop off into oblivion. Worst case scenario, people will flame you and the Brute Squad or i will step in and delete the thread. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. No fuss, no muss.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do a lot off-topic stuff on forums, we&#039;ll just ban you.                    </content>
